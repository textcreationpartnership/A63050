            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:93776:2"/>
            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHat is in this Book offered to your Reading, was, ſome years ſince, preached in the ordinary Couſe of my Ministry, on a Week day, with no more thought (that is none at all) of Printing it, than I had of Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this way, anything I have preached theſe Seven and twenty years, wherein I have been exerciſed in the Ministry of the Word, (ſave one ſingle Sermon, extorted from me about fourteen years ago.)</p>
            <p>The Publiſhing of ſuch plain Diſcourſes, is ſingly owing to the <hi>Importunity</hi> of ſome of the Hearers, and to the <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> they gave me, by getting what I ſpake, tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from two Short-hand Writers; without which I could not have Publiſhed it: My own Notes being only little Scraps of Heads of Doctrine, and Scriptures confirming them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93776:3"/>
            <p>In the ſame way I had brought to me, what I ſpoke from <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23,24. and have it lying by me; which may alſo ſee the Light, if the Lord will that I live, and if this be accepted of ſuch, whoſe Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I only value; I mean ſuch as are <hi>ſound in the Faith,</hi> and <hi>exerciſed in the life of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know no <hi>true Religion,</hi> but <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: No true Chriſtianity,</hi> but <hi>the Doctrine of Chriſt;</hi> of his <hi>Divine Perſon</hi> (the Image of the inviſible God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. of his <hi>Divine Office</hi> (the Mediator betwixt God and Men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.) of his <hi>Divine Righteouſneſs</hi> (He is the Lord our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. Which Name is alſo called upon his Church, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.16) and of his <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> (which all that are his, receave, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 9.) I know <hi>no true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt,</hi> but ſuch as make it their Buſineſs in their Calling, to commend <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his Saving fulneſs of Grace and Glory, to the faith and love of Men. <hi>No true Chriſtian,</hi> but one <hi>united to Chriſt by Faith, and abiding in him by Faith and Love,</hi> unto the glorifying of the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the Beauties of Goſpel-Holineſs. <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:93776:3"/> this Spirit, have for many years been my Brethren and Companions, and, I hope, ſhall ever be, whitherſoever the Hand of God ſhall lead me.</p>
            <p>Through the Lord's Mercy to me, (as to many in <hi>London</hi>) I have often heard what is far more worthy of the Preſs, than any thing I can publiſh. I have not been negligent in deſiring ſuch <hi>able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the New Teſtament,</hi> to let their Light ſhine this way; but have little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. It may be this mean Eſſay, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them more to that good Work.</p>
            <p>Whatever you may think of my way of managing this Subject (and indeed there is nothing in that, either as deſigned or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, or that in it ſelf deſerveth any great Regard.) Yet the Theme it ſelf, all muſt judge, who have ſpiritual Senſes, is of great Importance, and always ſeaſonable. It is concerning the <hi>Throne of God's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace, reared up in Jeſus Chriſt, and revealed unto Men in the Goſpel; with the Application all ſhould</hi> make to that Throne; <hi>The great Bleſſings to be reaped by that Application, and Men's great need of thoſe Bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:93776:4"/>
            <p>This greateſt of Subjects, is meanly, but honeſtly, handled in the ſame Order in which it was Preached, and moſtly in the ſame Words. Some few Paſſages out of Hiſtory, are inſerted, which were not ſpoken.</p>
            <p>May the <hi>Lord of the Harveſt, who miniſtred this Seed to the Sower,</hi> make it <hi>Bread to the Eater,</hi> and accompany it with his Bleſſing on ſome, that are <hi>called to inherit a Bleſſing,</hi> and I have my End and Deſire; the Reader ſhall have the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and the Lord the Glory: <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things; to whom be Glory for ever. Amen.</hi>

If the God-head of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be hid from the readers of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> it muſt be by a ſpecial Power of the <hi>God of this world on their unbelieving minds:</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3,4.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93776:7"/> eminent Type of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> By this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> we may know what <hi>Paul</hi>'s reaſonings with the <hi>Jews</hi> were; <hi>Acts</hi> 9.23. and what is the right way of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day; till <hi>Chriſts</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon, and Righteouſneſs, and Prieſthood have more room in the Religion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Chriſtianity is not like to leaven the <hi>Jews.</hi> This Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Prieſthood, and of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelf he offered in that Office, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth often intermix with ſuitable Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from it; as in the context, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then we have a great highprieſt</hi> (all the Old Teſtament Highprieſts were but types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Him, and were but little highprieſts) <hi>that is paſſed into the heavens</hi> (no highprieſt but Chriſt went further than the Holy of Holies for the peoples advantage) <hi>Jeſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion.</hi> The dignity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his advanced State, as well as his Grace in his humbled State, lays Chriſtians under a ſtrong engagement, to cleave to him, with ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt confidence. Yet for as great as this perſon is, and for all that he is in Heaven, and in unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dignity and Glory there, you muſt not think, that he in Heaven, and we on Earth, can have no communion: <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>for we have not an highprieſt which cannot be touched with the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our infirmities,</hi> (though now he hath none of his own, yet can he feel theſe of his people, and his feeling engageth ſpeedy relief). The reaſon the Apoſtle gives for this ſympathy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his people, is from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, when on earth, <hi>But was in all points tempted, like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> The Apoſtle delivers the mind of the Holy Ghoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſympathy, negatively, <hi>we have not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93776:7"/> an high-prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;</hi> in which manner of exhortation, he reflects on the meanneſs of the <hi>Levitical Prieſts,</hi> to whom it was impoſſible to know and feel all the infirmities of the people, for whom yet they appeard before God; and he implys the affirmative ſtrongly, <hi>we have an high prieſt which can be</hi> (and is) <hi>touched with the feeling of our infirmities.</hi> How a ſinleſs man, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever was, can be touched with the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the infirmities of ſinners, and many of theſe infirmities, ſinful ones; How a glorified man, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> now is, exalted to, and poſſeſſed of the higheſt Glory and Bliſs, can be, and is, touched with the feeling of all the infirmities of all his people, is what the word plainly reveals to be believed, but its not to be fully known, till we come to Heaven. But he is the Head, and all his people <hi>are his Body, his members, of his fleſh, and of his bones,</hi> Eph. 5.30. a marvellous word. Can the fleſh be torn, and the bones be broken, and the head not feel it? Though he be glorified, above what we can conceave, he is a living, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and compaſſionate Head, and as nearly and cloſely united to all his Members now, as when <hi>they ſaw with their eyes, and heard with their ears, and with their hands handled the word of life.</hi> 1 John 1.1. There is nothing ails a poor Believer in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there is no groan riſeth from his diſtreſſed Heart, but it is immediately felt at the tender Heart of the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand. We would groan and ſing with the ſame breath, if we believed this firmly.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93776:8"/>
               <p>In my Text there is a moſt bleſſed exhortation from this ſame ground of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſympathy in Heaven, unto a bold approaching to the Throne of Grace. The nativeneſs, and ſtrength of the Inference is obvious to the moſt ordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The exhortation is unto the improving of the greateſt priviledge, an erected and revealed Throne of Grace, and that in the practice of the greateſt Duty, believing approaching unto this Throne, or unto God ſitting on this Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>What I would take up in, and handle in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, theſe words, ſhall be the reſolution of four weighty Queſtions, which ſhould be in the hearts of all worſhippers of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt great Queſtion is, <hi>Where may I find God?</hi> This was <hi>Job</hi>'s queſtion and wiſh: <hi>Job</hi> 23.3. <hi>O that I knew where I might find him? that I might come even to his ſeat!</hi> and that this <hi>ſeat,</hi> was a Throne of Grace to <hi>Job,</hi> is evident from <hi>ver.</hi> 6. This Text tells you, God is on a <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi> A fit place for God to be ſought in, and where only he can be found graciouſly by a ſinner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Queſtion,</hi> is, How <hi>ſhould we come to God on this Throne? Let us come boldly,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi> The original word ſignifieth, <hi>coming freely, with free open bold ſpeaking, pouring out all our hearts and minds, to him.</hi> Let us come, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of Saint or Angel, to introduce us to this Throne. Any poor ſinner may come himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to this Court, and that boldy without fear of being repulſed</p>
               <p n="3">The 3 <hi>Queſtion</hi> is the hardeſt, <hi>what ground hath a ſinner for this boldneſs?</hi> The ground the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives for it, is hinted in the word <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93776:8"/> which relates to <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. Becauſe of <hi>Jeſus the Son of God, our great high-prieſt in heaven.</hi> If we had not ſuch a high-prieſt, miniſtring in glory at the high Altar above, no ſinner could come boldly to the Throne of Grace on earth. So he argues, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.19,20,21,22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt queſtion, is, <hi>What ſhall we get, and for what may we come to this Throne of Grace!</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks fully to this in the Text, let us come, <hi>that we may obtain mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi> Theſe precious things, <hi>Mercy and Grace</hi> are ſcattered round this Throne; any poor needy creature ſhould come for a ſaving Alms from this Throne, and may have it for the coming.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe I would begin with. <hi>Where is God to be found?</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, on a <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi> This word is only here: no where elſe in the Scriptures is the word to be found; but what is ſignified by it, is frequently in the Old and New Teſtament, as we ſhall hear. But though the phraſe, <hi>the Throne of Grace,</hi> be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once named in this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. yet the thing ſignified, is ſo precious, and the expreſſion of it, is ſo ſavory, ſignificant, and ſuitable, that this form of ſpeaking, <hi>the Throne of Grace,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come famous, known, and uſed amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and will doubtleſs be till the end of Time. As long as God hath a mind to give Mercy and Grace, as long as any of the Children of men are ſenſibly needy of Grace and Mercy, and askers and receivers thereof from the Lord, (and that will be till the Heavens be no more) this Throne of Grace will be plyed and praiſed.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93776:9"/>
               <p>I would firſt conſider the proper meaning of this word, <hi>a Throne of Grace.</hi> It's obvious, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> doth every where (if I may uſe a much abuſed word) <hi>Chriſten</hi> the Old Teſtament Types, and gives them New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament names, and applys them to the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he is teaching the <hi>Chriſtian Jews,</hi> he writes to. The Old Teſtament Church knew what a <hi>high-priest</hi> was, what his Inſtitution, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and performance were in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and in the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Canaan:</hi> But both <hi>Aron</hi> and his Succeſſors, and the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> were but Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his Perſon and Office. There was the <hi>Holieſt of all,</hi> into which the High-Prieſt went alone, and only once a year; in this was the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Mercy Seat,</hi> and <hi>Cherubims</hi> covering it, (whence theſe common expreſſions in the Old Teſtament of <hi>Gods dwelling between the Cherubims,</hi> and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers <hi>truſting in the ſhadow of his wings</hi>). Now the holieſt of all was their Type of Heaven, and the Ark, Cherubims, Mercy-Seat, were but all ſhadows (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls them <hi>heb.</hi> 10.1.) of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of that peace with God, and acceſs to God, that he hath wrought out for men. More particularly, that moſt ſacred of all things in the Jewiſh Old Teſtament-worſhip, that was called the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls a <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> thereby teaching us, that whatever of Divine Grace was revealed and tendred to, or perceived and received by the faith of the Old Teſtament Believers in their right uſe of theſe ſacred old Inſtitutions of God to his Church, the ſame with great advantage Believers under the New Teſtament have in <hi>Jeſus
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93776:9"/> Chriſt,</hi> the Body, Antitype, and ſubſtance of them.</p>
               <p>We find 3 moſt ſolemn Things in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, in which the Mercy-Seat (the Type of the Throne of Grace in the New Teſtament) was applyed unto. 1. The <hi>moſt ſolemn approach</hi> was made unto God, in the High-prieſts going in once a year to the holieſt of all, where the Mercy-Seat was. This was made, not by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their own perſons, nor by any ordinary <hi>Levite,</hi> who were priviledged with a greater nearneſs to God, then the people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.9. Nor by any of the inferior Prieſts of the Houſe of <hi>Aaron,</hi> to which family the Office of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was by divine appointment confined; nor by the High-prieſt himſelf, but only once a year at a determinate time, and with many appointed Ceremonies of preparation and performance. Some tell us of a cuſtom in their Worſhip, that Muſick by Singing and Inſtruments was uſed by the people, to expreſs their Joy and Praiſe, when the High-prieſt returned ſafe out from that Sacred and Awful place, the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi> 2. The moſt <hi>ſolemn attonment for the ſins of Iſrael</hi> was made at the Mercy-Seat. This was done in that yearly entrance of the High-prieſts into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of all. <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.12,13. eſpecially <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>And he</hi> (<hi>Aaron,</hi> the firſt of that Order of Prieſts) <hi>ſhall take of the blood of the Bullock, and ſprinkle it with his finger on the Mercy-ſeat caſtward; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mercy-ſeat ſhall he ſprinkle of the blood with his finger, ſeven times.</hi> ver. 30. <hi>On that day ſhall the Priest make an attonement for you, to cleanſe you, that ye may be clean from all your ſins before the Lord.</hi> 3. The moſt <hi>ſolemn anſwers</hi> were given by God to their High-prieſt; <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.17,22.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93776:10"/> where we have the Inſtitution of the <hi>Mercy-ſeat,</hi> and the form of it. And there (ſaith the Lord) <hi>will I meet with thee, and will I commune with thee.</hi> And again <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.6. What the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> was, and what their <hi>Shechinah</hi> was, neither <hi>Jew</hi> now, nor <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> know, though they gueſs; Only that they were ſpecial manifeſtations of the grace and favour, and mind of God, which expired with, and ſome of them, its thought, before the end of that miniſtration. But all theſe three Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Dignities and advantages of their <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> are all to be found in <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> who repreſents his people before God, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them to him, who hath made the perfect attonment for all his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and who declares to his Church all the ſaving will of God, which he heard and received of his Father.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle here in this Epiſtle, and in this Text, would have all Belivers in Chriſt to know, that the New Teſtament <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> is the ſame in ſubſtance with, and with great advantage above the Old Teſtament <hi>Mercy-ſeat.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4.—8.</p>
               <p>The Truth I would ſpeak to is this, <hi>That God in the Goſpel ſits on a Throne of Grace, and from it calls and invites ſinners to come unto him. Let us come to the Throne of Grace,</hi> certainly means, <hi>Let us now come to God ſitting on a Throne of Grace;</hi> Let us take both direction and encouragement to come to God, becauſe he is on a Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>In handling of this point of Doctrine, I would ſhew Three things. 1. What this Throne of Grace is, and how diſtinguiſhed from other Thrones of God, ſpoke of in the word. 2. Why
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93776:10"/> it is ſo called, a Throne, and a Throne of Grace. 3. What coming to this Throne is.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is this <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> and how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from other Thrones of God, ſpoke of in the Word. Theſe other I would firſt name to prevent miſtakes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We find a <hi>Throne of Glory</hi> much ſpoke of, a Throne of the Eſſential, Incompreheſible Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God. This no man can approach to. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>He dwelleth in light that no man can approach to, whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee.</hi> Marvellous is this Light. We find the more light there be in or about a perſon or. thing, the more eaſily and clearly it is perceived. As the Sun is ſuch a glorious Body, that though it be at a vaſt diſtance from the earth we dwell on, we yet can take it up with our eyes immediately; aſſoon as it ſhines, we can ſee it, becauſe of its light: It is its own light and nothing elſe, that doth or can diſcover it. If the Sun did withdraw its own light, all the eyes of men, and all the artificial Fire and Light men can make, would never help us to find it out. But ſuch is the Majeſty of God, that he is <hi>clothed with it. Pſal.</hi> 93.1. Men are dazled and confounded by a little Ray of his Glory. <hi>With God is terrible Majesty. Job</hi> 37.22. This is not the Throne we are called to come unto. They are but triflers in Religion, that know not in their Experience, how overwhelming the Views and Thoughts of Gods Majeſty and Glory are, when he is not ſeen as on a Throne of Grace. <hi>I remembred God and was troubled,</hi> ſaith one Saint; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.3. <hi>I am troubled at his preſence, when I conſider, I am afraid of him;</hi> ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Job</hi> 23.15. No wonder <hi>Manoah</hi> ſaid unto
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93776:11"/> his Wife, <hi>we ſhall ſurely die, becauſe we have ſeen God.</hi> Judg. 13.22. When a view of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> makes <hi>John,</hi> who was wont to lean on his boſom in his humbled State, <hi>to fall down at his feet as dead,</hi> Rev. 1.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Throne <hi>of Gods Government of the World,</hi> oft ſpoke of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.4,7. On this Throne God fits and rules all things at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in Infinite Wiſdom. This Throne is to be believingly regarded by us, but it is not the Throne of Grace that ſinners are called to come unto, for Grace and Mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>Throne of Gods Justice</hi> ſpoken of. This is that Throne <hi>David</hi> deprecates his being brought before, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Enter not into judegment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be justified.</hi> If a man be wronged and oppreſſed by men ſtronger than he, he may appeal to this Throne of Juſtice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect redreſs. But if a mans buſineſs be with God, he ſhould be afraid of this Throne of Juſtice. Men are oft proud and vain in their thoughts, and before others; but if the Lord call them before this High Court of Juſtice, they will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be caſt. <hi>Job</hi> 9.2,3. <hi>How ſhould a Man be just with God! If he will contend with him, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi> When God ſits on a Throne of Juſtice, to judge men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Law and their Works, nothing but Condemnation can juſtly be pronounced on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Whoever he be of ſinful <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſeed, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth ſaving favour from God's Throne of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, will find himſelf wofully deceived.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We find the <hi>Throne of the last judgment:</hi> before this all muſt appear. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. This is not the Throne of Grace in the Text.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93776:11"/> No grace nor mercy is ſhown to any from this Throne, but to them that have plyed and ſped at the Throne of Grace before. When our Lord comes and <hi>ſits on the Throne of his Glory,</hi> Mat. 25.31. no ſinner that hath deſpiſed his Grace now, will find any quarter then. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27.</p>
               <p>What then is this Throne of Grace? It is God in <hi>Christ,</hi> dealing with men according to the Grace of the Goſpel. It is <hi>God in Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world to himſelf, not imputing to them their treſpaſſes.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. It <hi>is Christ ſet forth by God, to be a propitiation.</hi> Rom. 3.25. This is the true <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> or <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> or <hi>Propitiation.</hi> 1 John 2.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 John 4.10. This is the New Court or Throne erected by God and declared in the Goſpel, to which ſinful man is invited to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why is it called a <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi> Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what is ſaid, of the <hi>Apostles</hi> alluding to the <hi>Mercy-ſeat</hi> in the Tabernacle and Temple of Old.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is called a Throne, becauſe <hi>of the Glory and Majesty of God manifested here.</hi> God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to diſplay and diſpenſe his Grace and Mercy to ſinners, is no debaſing of God, but an advancing of his Glory: When he gives Grace, he acts Royally, and as a King, with Majeſty. <hi>Araunahs</hi> offering to <hi>David,</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be like a King;</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.23. he was no King, but a Subject, but he had a free noble Heart. The Lord on this Throne of Grace, diſpenſeth all acts of Grace with great Majeſty, and as a King. But not as a King-Judge and Ruler, but as a King-Benefactor, and Giver. This Royalty of Grace ſhines, 1. In the <hi>greatneſs of the Gifts,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93776:12"/> Grace and Mercy.</hi> Vaſtly above all that the Creation can give. 2. In the <hi>manner of giving.</hi> Free, Soveraignly free. Grace and Mercy is his own, and he doth with them as he will. When <hi>Moſes</hi> prays, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy Glory:</hi> We cannot conceive what was in his holy heavenly heart. He was now juſt come down from the Mount the firſt time, he is going up again to ſpend other 40 days there in ſuch Communion with God, as never meer man enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before or ſince, out of Heaven; he had prevailed with God for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and hath a moſt gracious anſwer <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, I will do this thing alſo that thou hast ſpoken; for thou hast found grace in my ſight, and I know thee by name.</hi> What means <hi>Moſes</hi> then by this prayer? <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. What ever he meant, the Lords anſwer is much to be obſerved. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>And he ſaid, I will make all my goodneſs</hi> (or Beauty) <hi>paſs before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee.</hi> (What is in this Name that hath ſo much of Glory and Goodneſs in it, as ſhould ſatisfie ſuch a mighty hungerer for more of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was?) <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi> God's Glory ſhines highly, in his being the Soveraign diſpoſer of his own Grace and Mercy: and happy is the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that adores this glorious Soveraignty. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15.25. makes a deep improvement of it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.12. <hi>A glorious high throne from the beginning, is the place of our ſanctuary.</hi> See then that you in all your pleadings for Grace and Mercy, remember that you are before a high ſtately Throne. Approaches to God on the Throne of Grace, ſhould be managed with the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93776:12"/> deepeſt Reverence and Humility. So did the <hi>Publican,</hi> when he came to it; <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. <hi>God be merciful</hi> (propitious) <hi>to me a ſinner</hi> (or me the ſinner, the great ſingular ſinner: So the <hi>Greek</hi> runs, as <hi>Luke</hi> 7.37,39.) The deepeſt, profoundeſt adoration of the Glorious Majeſty of God, is performed by a ſelf-condemned ſinner, pleading at this Throne for the obtaining of the ſoveraign free grace of God. <hi>Lastly,</hi> it is called a Throne, becauſe Grace reigns and is enthron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Grace reigns through righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto eternal life by Jeſus Christ our Lord.</hi> Bleſſed Reign: and bleſſed are all that are under the Reign and Dominion of the Grace of God. Sin reigned through the unrighteouſneſs of the <hi>first Adam</hi> unto eternal death, if men be let alone, and if Grace do not break this Reign of ſin; and Grace reigns through the righteouſneſs of the <hi>Second Adam</hi> unto etrnal life; and nothing can dethrone Grace; it will prevail, and reach its end, eternal life, in all it falls upon. O that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to Satan, and ſlaves to Sin and the Law, would long to be under the Reign of this ſtately power, the Grace of God? And that Believers themſelves would give a more free and large ſubjection to it!</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is called a <hi>Throne of Grace:</hi> 1. Becauſe <hi>Grace erected and reared it up. Pſal.</hi> 89.2. <hi>Mercy ſhall be built up for ever.</hi> Nothing but Grace and Mercy framed the Throne of Grace. I may allude to the Lords ſtately words to <hi>Job</hi> 38.4,5,6, ſpeaking of the firſt Creation (but this <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> was fixed before, as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23. <hi>I was ſet up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</hi>) <hi>Where waſt thou when I laid the foundation, and who laid
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93776:13"/> the corner stone thereof?</hi> No creature was on the Counſel: It is a Divine Contrivance; but now it is revealed, our faith on the ground of this Revelation, may and ſhould go back, and take a refreſhing view of this eternal Contrivance. The Lord builds a Houſe of Mercy, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſinners may dwell in, with him, for ever. What laid the foundation of this houſe, but Grace? What laid the Corner Stone of this Throne, but Grace? What brings in the Inhabitants, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them, and perfects them, but Grace? For whom is it prepared, and by whom ſhall this Houſe of Mercy be poſſeſſed, and with whom ſhall it be filled, but with, <hi>veſſels of mercy whom he had afore prepared unto glory?</hi> Rom. 9.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is called a <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> becauſe <hi>Grace hath here, and here only, a glorious diſplay and diſcovery.</hi> Till men get a ſight of God in <hi>Christ,</hi> they cannot tell what the grace of God is; ſearch Heaven and Earth, you can never get a view of God's Grace, till ye come to this Throne. You may ſee Gods Infinite Power, and Wiſdom, and Goodneſs written in great Characters, in the great volume of Creation and Providence; But till ye come to know God in <hi>Christ</hi> on this Throne, you can never ſee that Divine Dainty, and Saving Bleſſing, the <hi>free Grace of God:</hi> Grace as an everlaſting fountain in the Heart of God, pouring down, ſtreaming forth, eternal Salvation on ruined unworthy ſinners. Men ſhould make a viſit to the Throne of Grace, if they had no other errand, but to get a ſight of this precious Thing, the Grace of God. A right ſight of it is ſaving. Believers ſhould long to be in Heaven, if they had no other errand, then to ſee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93776:13"/> the Spring-Head of that Flood of Grace that came down from Heaven, to drag them out of Hell, and to draw them up to Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is called a Throne of Grace, becauſe <hi>all the Acts and Sentences paſt at this new Court, are all acts of Grace, all the Bleſſings given from this Throne are all of meer Grace. Nothing is here, but Grace.</hi> John 1.17. <hi>The law was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Christ.</hi> Was there no Grace nor Truth under the Law? Yes, a great deal; but it all belonged to <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> There was Grace under the Law, but none, but what related to <hi>Jeſus Christ:</hi> There was Truth under the Law, but only as <hi>Christ</hi> was pointed at; otherwiſe all were but vain and beggerly Rudiments, and empty dark Shadows. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſee nothing of <hi>Christ</hi> in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and therefore find neither the ſaving Mercy nor ſaving Truth of God in it. And it is much worſe with men (<hi>Christians</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call them) that ſee as little of Chriſt in the New Teſtament. Take the Chain of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and all the Links of it, as the Apoſtle names them; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29,30. and all of them are of Grace. We are choſen by Grace; we are given to <hi>Christ</hi> by Grace; Redeemed by him by Grace; By Grace we are juſtified through that Redemption; by the ſame Grace we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted; by the ſame Grace we are ſaved by the waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt; and by Grace we ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. And they that will not claim theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and hold them by this Tenure of free Grace, I dare not ſay that they ſhall never have them (for this Grace can overcome its greateſt enemies) but I may ſay, that they have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93776:14"/> no part or portion in this matter, and when they come to partake of Grace, and to <hi>know the Grace of God in Truth,</hi> as <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. they will be of another mind, and count it the beſt Tenure to hold all by, even by free Grace. Yea after all the Riches of Grace poured forth on Believers in this life, when they come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Crown of Glory, they receive it as humbly, yea more, than they did any former Act of Grace from this Throne. The over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer by the <hi>Blood of the Lamb,</hi> will receive the Crown from his Glorious Redeemer, as humbly, and with owning it as a gift of Grace, as much, as ever he did receive a pardon in that Blood, when his head was on the Block, and the Ax of Law and Juſtice lifted up to cut him off for his Iniquity. There may be proud Pleaders for (or rather preſumers and expecters of) the Crown of Glory, but no proud receivers of it. We muſt <hi>look for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Christ unto eternal life.</hi> Jude 21. Merit and Worth are only for Hell; and they have no room in Heaven, nor in the way to it. Juſtice reigns in Hell, and Grace in Heaven. So all will find that come to Heaven, and ſo muſt they all know and believe, that would be there. Sinners that are for Merit, will find it ſadly in Hell; Mens Merit makes Hell, and <hi>Christ</hi>'s Merit makes Heaven. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is called a Throne of Grace, becauſe <hi>the Glory of Grace is the last and highest end of the building of this Throne, and of all the acts of Grace diſpenſed at it, and from it.</hi> That proud <hi>Monarch</hi> ſpoke vainly and wickedly, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. and was quickly by God, puniſhed ſeverely for his ſin. If we may be allowed to allude to ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93776:14"/> words, we may ſay of the Throne of Grace, <hi>Is it not that high Throne that God hath built for the houſe of his Kingdom, by the might of his power, and for the honour of the Majesty of his Grace?</hi> Are any choſen in <hi>Christ,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to the adoption of Children by him? It is to <hi>the praiſe of the glory of his grace?</hi> Eph. 1.4,5,6. Do they believe by Grace? it is to the <hi>praiſe of his glory; verſ.</hi> 12. are they ſealed, and at laſt poſſeſſed of Heaven: that is <hi>to the praiſe of his glory. verſ.</hi> 14. Are they quickned, when dead in ſin, and advanced in and by <hi>Christ Jeſus:</hi> this is to the <hi>praiſe of his Grace. Eph.</hi> 2.4.7. All the bleſſings in Time and Eternity, that the Heirs of Grace enjoy, are all to the praiſe and glory of that Grace they ſpring from. We read in the word, of none of the Counſels of God, before the Creation of all things, but of his purpoſe of ſaving of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of poor ſinful men by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of no other deſign in this purpoſe, but to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Grace in ſaving of them this way. So much of the ſignification of this word, a <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. What is it <hi>to come unto this Throne of Grace.</hi> Though the proſecuting of the Exhortation in this Text, will open up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the nature of this coming more fully, yet I would ſpeak ſomewhat of it in this place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This coming implys a <hi>ſtate of diſtance from this Throne in them that are called to come.</hi> This is called, <hi>being far off,</hi> Eph. 2.13. and this ſtate all men by nature are in. Men are in God's Eye and Hand, <hi>he is not far from every
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93776:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> one of us, for in him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> Acts 17.27,28. As the <hi>Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt</hi> ſpeaks excellently in. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men to God, and of his Omnipreſence, and Omniſcience. But his gracious preſence, as on a Throne of Grace, is far from all then by nature, and they far from it. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is far from man's knowledge; no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it but by Revelation: Far from mens attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for no man can come unleſs he be drawn of God, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. Far from their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and far from their Love; for they <hi>are alienated from the life of God.</hi> Eph. 4.18. And in <hi>his favour is life, Pſal.</hi> 30.5. and in nothing elſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo implyed in this Call to come, That there is a gracious proviſion made and revealed by God, for the removal and making up of this Diſtance, and getting of a gracious nearneſs to God. This is in the Conſtitution and Revelation of this Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the improving of this Proviſion is Mens Duty, and ſhould be their exerciſe, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to poſſeſs and enjoy the Priviledge and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, of this Proviſion.</p>
               <p>What then is this Coming to the Throne of Grace?</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is <hi>in Believing on Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is the firſt approach to the Throne of Grace. He is the <hi>propitiation</hi> and <hi>Mercy-Seat</hi> and <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. Believing on him <hi>is coming to him, John</hi> 6.35. It is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Father by him. John</hi> 14.6. It is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on God by him.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. It is <hi>believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, and on him that ſent him. John</hi> 12.44.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93776:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> Believing on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is an imploying of Chriſt in way of Truſt, as to all his fulneſs of Grace, and our utter indigence thereof: Whatever a man do, whatever Exerciſes of Religion he be taken up in, he never comes to the Throne of Grace, till his heart and Soul go forth towards <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> for Righteouſneſs and Life. The firſt right ſtep heaven-ward, is ſaving faith in <hi>Christ.</hi> Nothing ſavingly good can preceed it, and all ſaving good follows it; for faith unites the man to <hi>Christ,</hi> and all the fruits of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Righteouſneſs, ſpring from the virtue of the Vine <hi>Christ,</hi> with whom the Believer hath firſt union by Grace, and then communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts grace, by which he lives, and works, and grows.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Coming to this Throne, is acted <hi>in all acts of Goſpel-worſhip, and in the uſe of all Goſpel-ordinances.</hi> They all belong to the Throne of Grace, are the Inſtitutions of this Throne, and appointed as means wherein we ſhould approach to it, and which, when bleſſed by the appointer of them, do convey to us the Bleſſings of this Throne. Of them there are ſeveral, 1. <hi>Prayer;</hi> This is coming to to the Throne of Grace, if rightly managed. Though <hi>asking</hi> is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in this <hi>ver.</hi> yet it is ſtrongly implyed, both in the commanded <hi>Coming,</hi> and in the expreſſed <hi>obtaining of Mercy,</hi> and <hi>finding of grace to help in time of need.</hi> All that make a faſhion of Prayer do not come to the Throne of Grace, yet all that pray rightly do come to it. And becauſe this approaching to the Throne of Grace by and in Prayer, is plainly hinted in the Text, and is ſo commonly underſtood by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93776:16"/> Chriſtians, I would have my eye principally upon it, in handling this Scripture. 2. There is the <hi>word Read, Preached, and Meditated on, that is another principal means,</hi> in which men ſhould approach to the Throne of Grace. In Prayer, we pour out our heart before this Throne, and expreſs our Deſires to him that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on it; In the Word, the King on this Throne delivers his Will and Mind to us; And we ſhould come to hear it, and receive the Law from his Mouth. <hi>Cornelius</hi> expreſſed an excellent frame for this Ordinance. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> This word is the <hi>word of his Grace.</hi> Acts 20.32. It is the Proclamation of his Grace to Men. 3. <hi>Praiſing of God,</hi> is a coming to the Throne of Grace. This is the Sacrifice we ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by our high Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. Who minds this as they ought? If we want, we ask, and ſo we ſhould. But where is the Chriſtian that can ſay, though I had nothing to ask, I would yet go to the Throne of Grace, that I might praiſe him that ſits on it? 4. <hi>Receabing of the Lord's Supper,</hi> is a coming to the Throne of of Grace; to feaſt on the King of Grace, to feed on that Body broken for us, and that Blood ſhed for us, that is given to us in the Word for food to our Souls, and is given to us by his Command, in Bread and Wine at his Table, that in eating and drinking of them, we may remember him, and ſhow forth his Death till he come; glorying, and avowing, and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we have our ſalvation and all our hopes of it, built and fixed on that man <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93776:16"/> that was rejected by the Builders in his Time, and hath had little better entertaiment ſince, becauſe they knew him not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Application,</hi> Is there a Throne of Grace, and doth God ſitting on it, invite and call men to come to it, or to him on it? We are called to admire, adore, and praiſe the Grace that ſhines in this Conſtitution of God, and call to men. That perſon is ſadly out in his praiſes (and ſuch are never right in their Prayers) that doth not deeply admire, and heartily praiſe for this Mercy of a Throne of Grace. We count a man ill imployed in prayer, that asks many things of God, but forgets to ask the One thing needful; Is he any better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in praiſe, who gives thanks for many Mercies, but neglects or forgets to praiſe for the Greateſt of all Mercies, the Throne of Grace? Before which all Prayer and Praiſe muſt come, if accepted, and for which, high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt praiſes ſhould be given. In order to the raiſing of more Senſe of this Higheſt Favour, that God now deals with us on a Throne of Grace. Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Deep condeſcendence of Grace</hi> that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this Diſpenſation. There is a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Stately ſtooping in it. The Lord had reſolved in his own Heart, from Eternity, to have the company of many of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-ſpring, for ever with him in Heaven. He ſeeth them fallen into a deep Pit, out of which they can never get out by themſelves. God and Man by ſin are at a vaſt diſtance. Sinners cannot remove it, nor make ſo much as one ſtep towards God; Saved they cannot be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Diſtance be removed; Saved they muſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93776:17"/> be, becauſe of his unalterable purpoſe. In this caſe, ſaith the Lord of Meer Grace, if men cannot aſcend up to me, I will deſcend down to them, and draw them up again to me. This conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendence of Grace, we ſhould admire and praiſe. When <hi>David</hi> had got a gracious Meſſage and promiſe from God (and <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> was in it) 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. he ſits down as a man amazed before the Lord, and moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly expreſſeth his Admiration and Praiſe. <hi>Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my houſe? and is this the manner of men? and what can</hi> David <hi>ſay more?</hi> and what can <hi>David</hi> ſay better? to be ſwallowed up of Wonder, is the beſt and higheſt praiſing: who can forbear wondering at Grace, that conſiders duly whoſe Grace it is, where it finds us, and whither it brings us? When <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of it (and it was his uſual Theme) how ſweetly doth he diſcourſe of it? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. Where did this Grace find him and the <hi>Epheſians?</hi> what was their caſe and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for Grace? They were <hi>dead in ſin, walking after the courſe of this world, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prince of the power of the air, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing powerfully in them as children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> they were <hi>fulfilling the deſires and lusts of the fleſh and of the mind, they were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the children of wrath, even as others.</hi> Who can be lower, vifer, and baſer, except they that are in Hell it ſelf? Yet in this Caſe and Condition, Grace made its firſt viſit to them. All that this ſaving Grace falls on, are loſt and undone ſinners, men at the very brink of Hell. An Elect child of God, is worſt and moſt ſinful, the moment preceeding his Converſion. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:93776:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> was at his worſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. when Grace fell up him. If there be nothing, but the power of Grace, that can ſubdue the corruption of Nature; if this corruption grow in its ſtrength, till that ſubduing power of Grace be applyed; and if there be no middle State betwixt Death and Life, (and theſe have been reckoned Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Truths) how plain is it, that a ſinner is at his worſt, when ſaving Grace firſt comes upon him? 2. Whither did this Grace bring <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and ſo all Chriſtians? Out of the Grave of ſin, unto a new Life, and up to heavenly places in <hi>Christ Jeſus. ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. O what a mighty Arm hath the Grace of God? Its nothing for Grace to pull a man out of Hell, and ſet him down in Heaven. When ſhall this <hi>Arm of Jehovah be revealed?</hi> When will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſinners long for a ſaving pull of the Grace of God? 3. What is all this great Work of Grace for? <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>That in the ages to come, he might ſhow the exceeding riches of his Grace, in his kindneſs towards us through Christ Jeſus.</hi> As if the <hi>Apostle</hi> had ſaid, <hi>You and I cannot ſufficiently, in our time and age, admire this kindneſs, Grace, and Riches of Grace through</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved; but as long as this world lasts, and as long as there are receivers of this ſame Grace in future ages (and that will be as long as the world lasts; for the world lasts for the ſake of the Throne of Grace, and for what God hath to do on it, and to give from it) there will be praiſers of this Grace (for every Generation of Receivers of this Grace owe praiſes for all the Grace bestowed on all that have been before
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93776:18"/> them) And when this world is at an end, there is a better world that ſhall ſucceed it, wherein better and higher praiſes will be given forever; there is no other muſick but the praiſes of free Grace, in Heaven; and none ſhall ſing its praiſes there, but the happy Receavers of it here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the <hi>Infinite Wiſdom of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance</hi> of a Throne of Grace for ſinners. The Lord wiſely conſulted poor mans caſe, his Sinfulneſs, his Miſery, and his Infirmity. No where elſe can God and Sinners meet in Peace, but at this Throne of Grace. Here is the <hi>manifold wiſdom of God.</hi> Eph. 3.10. <hi>Grace abounds in all wiſdom and prudence:</hi> Eph. 1.8. Yet not according to the ſorry Rules of the <hi>wiſdom of this world, nor of the Princes</hi> (or great, leading men) <hi>of this world that come to nought. But the wiſdom of God in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, even the hidden wiſdom</hi> (hid to them that are loſt 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.) <hi>which God ordained before the world unto our glory: which none of the Princes of this world knew; for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> God and Holy Angels may meet in peace, whenever he is pleaſed to manifeſt his Glory to them: though they be ſenſible of their meanneſs as Creatures, and deeply humble before his Majeſty. But where God and Angels meet comfortably, God and ſinners cannot meet comfortably, That Light and Manifeſtation of divine Glory that makes a holy Angel happy, would confound and deſtroy a ſinful man. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6.1,5. The <hi>Seraphims</hi> adore humbly and praiſe, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a ſinner ſinks: he is terrified with the Sight
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93776:18"/> and with the Song. And yet this was a ſight of <hi>Christ, John</hi> 12.41. but his divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and Holineſs as God, was then repreſented to him, which terrified the Prophet. But when ſin is forgiven by an act of Grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. then upon the Lords ſaying, <hi>whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us?</hi> Iſaiah <hi>anſwered here am I ſend me.</hi> Now I have taſted the Grace of my Lord, I will run his errands let him ſend me where, and on what he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider how <hi>coſtly</hi> the erecting of this Throne of Grace was. It was a dear Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Throne of Gods eſſential glory is in his own ſuper-excellent Being, and falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no acts of the divine Will. When he had a mind to rear up a Throne of Glory to his name, in creating a world, there was no more needful, but his word of Power, his Almighty <hi>Fiat, Let it be,</hi> and all things ſprung up out of nothing, in marvelous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Beauty, and Goodneſs. But when a Throne of Grace is to be erected for ſinners, there is more to be done; here God's own Son muſt be made man, in that nature muſt be charged with their ſins, and muſt diſcharge that debt by bearing the Wrath of God, and curſe of the Law, even unto death; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. the Apoſtle gives us a deſcription of the Throne of Grace. <hi>God hath ſet forth Christ to be a propitiation</hi> (a Mercy Seat, a Throne of Grace). But his <hi>Blood</hi> went for it: Law and Juſtice exacted it, and <hi>Christ</hi> paid it. On this comes forth the bleſſed Proclamation of Grace, <hi>whoever he be of lost mankind, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93776:19"/> will come to this Throne of Grace by Faith, and will receive his Justification in, and by this Blood, and will trust to it only, ſhall never come into condemnation.</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> preached <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38,39. What is this grace revealed for? <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>To declare at this time, Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> We all know that God is juſt and the condemner of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of his Holy Law; But how the Goſpel is framed ſo, as that God's juſtice may appear in juſtifying of a believing ſinner, is far deeper, and more hardly known and believed. But take in but theſe three things, and it will appear.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God was juſt and the puniſher of the ſins of the Elect laid on <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> God's ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Son, and laying of the ſins of his people on him, was an act of amazing grace and mercy. But the exacting the debt of ſin of him, when the Father laid it on, and the Son took it on him, was of Juſtice and ſtrict glorious Juſtice. Never did Juſtice ſhine ſo in its glory and purity, as in bruiſing the Son of God for the ſins that were laid on him. The ſending of millions to Hell for their own ſins (and all muſt go thither that have them to anſwer for (and all ſuch have them all to anſwer for, who offer to pay their debt with their own coyn) and have no intereſt in <hi>Chriſts</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking) is a diſplay of Divine Juſtice, that men may grumble at, but cannot hinder: The praiſe of ſpotleſs Juſtice, will riſe up to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the Torments of the Damned. But he that is ignorant of Gods Righteouſs, can
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93776:19"/> far leſs conceave the glory of Juſtice in bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a ſinleſs man, who was alſo <hi>in the form of God and counted it not robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Phil. 2,6. (though ſome in our days think it blaſphemy to ſay ſo) a perſon beloved of the Father above all creature-thought, and that for the ſins of others, and they alſo the beloved of the Father in his eternal purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is juſt in not exacting the ſame debt of ſin twice, both of his Son, and of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in whoſe ſtead he paid it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God is juſt in diſcharging of his Son, from whom he hath receaved the full and covenanted ſatisfaction for ſin; And he is juſt in diſcharging Them for whom this ſatisfaction was given. He is juſt in raiſing <hi>Christ</hi> from the dead, and <hi>he roſe for our juſtification.</hi> Rom. 4.25. We are <hi>juſtified freely by his Grace;</hi> but this free, free-grace flows to us, through the Channel of <hi>Redemption by the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> And both <hi>this Grace</hi> and <hi>this Blood,</hi> is ſet forth in the Goſpel to <hi>our Faith,</hi> and muſt be applyed unto by Faith, and applyed to us in believing. Whatever the Thoughts of Men be of theſe things, <hi>Free-grace</hi> and <hi>Dear-blood,</hi> are the ſtay of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed on Earth, and the everlaſting Song of all the glorified in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, to raiſe your Thoughts of the greatneſs of this Favour, of having a Throne of Grace to come to, conſider, <hi>what rich proviſions are made at this Throne for ſinners.</hi> This the Text ſpeaks of, and we ſhall in order handle them. Only now a few words. There is no Court in all Gods
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93776:20"/> Dominions, that a ſinner can come to, and find any mercy or grace, but only at this <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi> If you talk of Law or Juſtice or Equity, theſe are all frightful Courts to ſenſible ſinners: they know their Cauſe and Caſe is bad, and if they come to any Bar, but that of the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> they muſt be caſt. But at this <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> there they that have nothing, may get all things; they that deſerve nothing, may get every thing; they that deſerve Wrath, may obtain Mercy; they that are caſt and condemned at the Court of Juſtice, may be acquitted and freed from all ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and be adjudged to eternal life by the grace of God in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> All that is needful to Salvation is diſpenſed at this Throne. Yet all that is given, is old in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of grace from eternity, Old in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, Old in the purchaſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Only its newly given according to the ſinners neceſſity. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling</hi> (this was done, as yeſterday) But how came we by this ſaving and this calling? <hi>Not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace</hi> (<hi>Paul</hi> ſtill oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Works to Grace, and Grace to Works in the matters of Iuſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and ſo doth his Lord and Maſter that taught him, and ſo do all that know either grace or works rightly) <hi>which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began.</hi> Let this be ſtill kept in mind, that whatever you can need, there is a ſuitable and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93776:20"/> abundant ſupply, to be had at this Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Exerciſe, with nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two ſorts of people that will be ſpecially welcome to the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They that come to the Throne of Grace <hi>ſoon and early.</hi> I mean, young people, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that begin betimes, to be Courtiers and Attendants at this Throne. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me; and thoſe that ſeek me early, ſhall find me;</hi> ſaith the King on this Throne of Grace. O that young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would try and uſe this Throne of Grace betimes? They would find <hi>Chriſt</hi> very gracious to them; he would diſcover his Beauty and give them of his Love, that would cool their Thirſt after ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: They might grow rich and ſtrong in grace before they be old: Or, if they die young, they ſhould be tranſplanted to a better ſoil, and be nearer the Sun of Righteouſneſs, than they can be in this World. Never did a Saint got ſafe aſhore in Heaven, bewail his arriving there too ſoon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They that come to the Throne of Grace <hi>to Get,</hi> and <hi>and not to Give.</hi> Take heed to your Spirits in this matter. When you come to the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> come to receive out of Chriſts fulneſs, and come not to bring grace with you to add to Chriſt's Store. He loves to give and glories in giving, but he ſcorns to receive grace from you, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93776:21"/> in truth you have none but what he gives. Bring your wants to him to ſupply, but bring not your fulneſs to brag of. Spread your ſins before this Throne, with ſhame and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and plead for a gracious pardon; But take heed you bring not your ſorrow, tears, and repentance, nay nor your Faith it ſelf, as a plea for that pardon. How abominable is it to Chriſtians ears, and how much more unto Chriſt's, to hear a man plead thus for pardon, <hi>Here is my Repentance, where is thy Pardon? Here is my Faith, where is thy Juſtiſication?</hi> I know men abhorr to ſay ſo; but take good heed leſt any thought bordering on it, enter into thy heart. Faith is the <hi>Tongue</hi> that begs pardon, Faith is the <hi>Hand</hi> that receives it, It is the <hi>Eye</hi> that ſeeth it; but it is no <hi>price</hi> to buy it, Faith uſeth the Goſpel plea for pardon; but it ſelf, neither in habit nor act, is the plea it ſelf: that is only Chriſt's blood. Chriſt's blood goes for the Remiſſion of your ſins, if ever they be forgiven: and is the only plea to be heard at the Throne of Grace. There are too many like the <hi>Phariſee.</hi> Luke 18.11. It would ſeem by Chriſt's words <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. that both came for Juſtification. <hi>The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſce ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf, God I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican.</hi> Poor wretch; the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> was a far better man than he, as Chriſt teſtifieth. He came to the Throne of Grace, like a man that would carry ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. It is a Rule of this Court. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.53. <hi>He hath filled the hungry with good
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93776:21"/> things; but the rich he hath ſent empty away.</hi> According to this Rule, the Lord dealt with the <hi>Phariſee</hi> and the <hi>Publican;</hi> and ſo will he deal with you, as you are like the one or the other, in your approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to, and pleadings at, the <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi>

               <p>I Did take up this Exhortation, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an anſwer to four conſiderable Queſtions, that uſually are in the hearts of them that draw near to God ſeriouſly. 1. Where may we find Him? <hi>On a Throne of Grace.</hi> Seek him no where elſe, for no where elſe is he to be graciouſly found. 2. How ſhould we come to this Throne? <hi>Boldly,</hi> with confidence. 3. What is the ground of this boldneſs? It had need be a great and ſolid ground, on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93776:22"/> which a ſinner may build Boldneſs, in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to God. This ground is hinted by the Apoſtle in the word <hi>therefore:</hi> wherefore? <hi>Becauſe of our great High-prieſt, the Son of God, in Heaven. ver.</hi> 14, 15. Though there be nothing more commonly ſaid and owned, then that all men are ſinners, and that all the acceptance of a ſinner with God, is through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> yet I can aſſure you, that when a perſon ſeeth and knows what it is to be a ſinner, and knows what God is, it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful difficulty to believe, that it is poſſible that ſuch a ſinner, and ſuch a God, ſhould ever meet in Peace. Peoples dry No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Opinions of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (if there be no more) will ſoon be blown away, with a deen ſight of the ſinfulneſs of ſin, and of the Majeſty of God provoked thereby. 4. The laſt Queſtion is, <hi>What ſhall we get by coming?</hi> and <hi>what: ſhould we come for?</hi> The greateſt bleſſings: <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Grace.</hi> Theſe bleſſings are comprehenſive of all things needful to make a ſinner happy.</p>
               <p>To the firſt of theſe I began to ſpeak, laſt day. That <hi>God hath erected a Throne of Grace in the Goſpel, to which men are invited to come.</hi> What this Throne of Grace is, is ſpoke to; and that this Throne of Grace is to be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from all other Thrones of God, ſpoke of in the word. The Throne of <hi>his eſſential glory</hi> is unapproachable by all Creatures. The Throne of his <hi>Juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> dreadful to all ſinners: we ſhould pray againſt our coming before this Throne. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. He muſt be a proud ignorant fool, that would offer to come
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93776:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> and plead at its Bar, for here all Acts and Sentences paſs according to ſtrict Law and Juſtice; and the Law is an everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner of all ſinners. There is alſo the Throne <hi>of the</hi> Judge at the laſt day. But this Throne is not yet ſet, though it will ſurely be and we know not how ſoon, and ſhould prepare for our appearing before it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9,10.</p>
               <p>But this Throne of Grace is the Gracious manifeſtation of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> reconciling the World to himſelf. This is the <hi>light of the Glory of Gods Grace ſhining in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>ch.</hi> 5.18,19. And to coming to this Throne of Grace, and to God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſpenſing his grace from it, we are here exhorted and encouraged.</p>

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:93776:23"/> Chriſt,</hi> and therefore <hi>without hope in the world.</hi> Eph. 2.12. Never was there, nor will there be, nor can there be, any gracious approach unto God, nor any addreſs recieved favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by God, but at this Throne of Grace. Therefore whatever may be ſaid of the zealous devotion, and of the Moral Principles and Practices of the Heathens, yet never any of them did, nor could offer up an acceptable prayer unto God, nor obtain a gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from him; not only becauſe they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped an unknown God: <hi>Acts</hi> 17.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8. but mainly, becauſe they worſhiped not at this Throne of Grace; for there can be no Communion with God, there can be nothing graciouſly given by God to Men, nothing done by Men that can be accepted of God; but at this Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All ſhould come to this Throne, becauſe all men have <hi>need of the bleſſings diſpenſed</hi> at this Throne of Grace. Where there is an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal urgent neceſſity, and only one place of ſupply diſcovered, Men are called to betake themſelves thither. The bleſſings diſpenced at the Throne of Grace are equally needed by all. Every Man, every Woman, young or old, rich or poor, are equally needy, becauſe all are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peakably needy of the Mercy and Grace of God. Some indeed have a greater ſight and ſenſe of their wants than others, (and that is Mercy) but the real neceſſity is common to all; every unpardoned man needs a pardon at this Throne of Grace; but few, if any, value a pardon till they get it, or value the Grace of God; till they feel it. Do you feel your need of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93776:24"/> what is given and got at this Throne? Come, then. The Law thunders and roars againſt you, that you may ſee your need of coming hither, for what the Law cannot give, nor hinder you from receiving, nor rob you of when recieved. Do you think in your heart, that you are the moſt needy perſon in all the World, that you need all the Grace and Mercy, or more, than ever any ſinner recieved? Then come the rather, come the ſooner. The needieſt ſoul, the hungrieſt ſinner, the perſon moſt greedy of the Grace of God, ſhould come firſt to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s door, and beg lowdeſt. Is there any not needy? Alas! many think ſo, but none is ſo. Will you come for hunger and want? A ſenſible hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a ſenſe and ſight of need, an appetite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Grace and Mercy, is an Alms that <hi>Chriſt</hi> can give; and many Profeſſors want it ſadly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Command is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> to all that hear it. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Theſe things ſaith the Law to them that are under the Law.</hi> So I may ſay, This ſaith the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to all under the ſound of it, <hi>come to the Throne of Grace.</hi> It is no indifferent thing, God commands all men to come; Believing (that is coming) is commanded. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. Are you afraid to come? <hi>have not I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you?</hi> Joſhua 1.9. as God ſpake to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Will Men own Gods authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Law, and deny it in the Goſpel? Is he not the ſame God in both? He that commands you to have no other Gods beſides him, doth command you to believe on his Son
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93776:24"/> Jeſus, <hi>who is the true God and eternal Life.</hi> 1 John 5.20. If coming to the Throne of Grace were not commanded, not coming to it were no ſin; and who dare ſay ſo? Not believing on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the great Gopel ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe believing on him is the great Goſpel-Duty and work. <hi>John</hi> 6.29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But I am afraid he commands not me, others he may command; but not ſuch a vile dead Creature as I am.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Are you worſe than ſome he hath commanded? <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1,4,5. <hi>Thou haſt plaid the harlot with many lovers, yet return again to me ſaith the Lord.</hi> Such a practice in your Land, would greatly defile it, ſaith the Lord, but ſuch acts of Grace become the Throne of Grace. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17,18. Are you worſe than <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>miſerable,</hi> and <hi>wretched and naked?</hi> yet the King of this Throne commands them to come to him, though he ſweetly calls it <hi>Counſel;</hi> and in it we may joyn his two Names, <hi>Wonderfull, Counſelor.</hi> Iſ. 9.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls and invites them that are <hi>weary and heavy laden. Matth.</hi> 11.28. the <hi>thirſty,</hi> Iſ. 55.1. And I am not ſuch, and therefore he commands not me to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Do you expect any Grace but at this Throne of Grace? Think you to work it out in your ſelves, and come to him for more? Or to get the beginning ſome where elſe, and then come to Chriſt for the <hi>reſt.</hi> This bewrays your Pride and Ignorance of the intire cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of your Nature, and of your Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to any good. This frame diſcovers your Ignorance of the Nature of the Grace of God,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93776:25"/> that conſiſts in its freedom; as its Glory is, in its being the original cauſe of all Good, done for us, and wrought in us, or by us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt never bid any man be or do any thing without him, and then come to him, and he would do more for him. Chriſt calls men as he finds them, and then makes them what he would have them. <hi>He begins the good work in them and performs it.</hi> Phil. 1.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe and many ſuch like Calls and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, do not limit and reſtrain the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of the Goſpel command, but do graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly apply it to ſuch caſes wherein they that are, are apt to think that they are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally excepted. What is more common than ſuch arguings of Unbelief? I have a vaſt load of ſin lying on me, I have ſpent my time and ſtrength and money, on Sin and Vanity, I have been wearied in the greatneſs of my way of departing from the Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord will not recieve me. Therefore, ſuch are named particularly by the Lord, and ſpecially called.</p>
               <p>Therefore let no man whatſoever he hath been, or is, think that he is not commanded to come to this Throne of Grace. Take the command, lay it on your Conſcience, give O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it; take the command for your Warrant; and never fear but ye ſhall be welcome. Can your ſoul ſay, Lord, no man out of Hell is more needy of thy ſaving Grace than I, no ſinner, more unworthy of it than I, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou commandeſt me to come, I come to beg and to recieve. He will ſweetly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve you. <hi>Him that cometh to me I will in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93776:25"/> no wiſe caſt out. John</hi> 6.37. A Text that hath been an Anchor-hold to many a ſinking ſinner.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All ſhould come to the Throne of Grace, becauſe of the <hi>univerſality, vaſt extent and indefiniteneſs of the promiſe of welcome to all that come.</hi> The <hi>Command</hi> of God is a warrant and ground for our Obedience, and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> is a ground for <hi>confidence.</hi> The promiſe is Gods great mean for working faith: Faith is the impreſſion God makes on the ſoul of a man by the Promiſe. When God takes the promiſe of the Goſpel, and applies it with the power of his grace upon the ſoul, it leaves an abiding Mark and Signature, and that is Faith. The promiſe comes as the promiſe of a faithful God who cannot lie, of a great ſalvation, to a great ſinner. When the ſinner ſeeth and feels the truth and goodneſs of this promiſe, he believes. This promiſe of God is to be preached to all that hear the Goſpel: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this promiſe is the Goſpel, the Lord will make it effectual as he ſeeth good. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> encouraged ſuch men to come to the throne of grace, who, if ever any in the world ſhould have been kept back, it ſhould have been they: a crew of the bloody <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of the Son of God.</hi> But the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by <hi>Peter</hi> takes hold of their ſouls: and they cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> No wonder they ſaid ſo, when the cry of <hi>Chriſts Blood</hi> was in their Conſciences. The Apoſtle ſaith to them <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptiſed every one of you in the name of the</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. &amp;c.</hi> their ſin was very great,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93776:26"/> peculiar to them only, none before, nor after them, were guilty of this. The cry of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood is a dreadful cry; but this was more than all the Murthers ever committed in the World. It was the murthering of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> it was ſlaying the <hi>Prince of Life,</hi> it was all that the Devil and wicked World could do, to cut the Throat of the Goſpel, and of all the Elect of God; and, this wicked Act was done againſt Chriſt, becauſe he taught that he was the Son of God, and that he came from the Father to be the Saviour of the World. Yet ſaith the Apoſtle to them, Repent and be baptized in his name, for the remiſſion of that ſin, you that have been dipt in his blood, and ſo dreadfully guilty by the ſhedding of it, be baptized in his name for the remiſſion of that guilt and of all others. This calling for repenting of their guilt of Chriſt's blood, was plainly a requiring of Faith in him; not only that he was the Lord Chriſt they had ſlain in their unblief, but that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the vertue of that Blood, might be had by them on their betaking themſelves to him by Faith. So did the ſame Apoſtle preach to the <hi>Council,</hi> Acts 5.28,31. when he and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren were charged by the <hi>High-priest</hi> for filling <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>intending to bring his blood upon them. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> He directs them to look to Chriſt as the giver of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for, and of forgiveneſs of all their ſins, not excluding, but by <hi>v.</hi> 30. plainly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93776:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> including the greateſt of all their ſins, their <hi>ſlaying of Chriſt, and hanging him on a tree;</hi> and this they did <hi>with wicked hands,</hi> Acts 2.23. and with hearts as wicked as their hands. Yet thus did <hi>Peter</hi> preach Chriſt: So well did he remember his Lords command, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47. <hi>That repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at</hi> Jeruſalem. His argument is, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>For the promiſe is to you and your children.</hi> Had they not ſlain the Heir, and foundation of all the promiſes? had they not done as much as men could do, to forfeit all intereſt in the promiſe? Yes; but <hi>Peter</hi> ſtill invites them to the throne of grace, by an intereſt yet in the promiſe. The promiſe of grace and ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, is the Rope and Cord that God caſts out to ſinking ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: its equally in the offer of all in the Goſpel. Its true, that the Lord means and deſigns it to ſome particular perſons; but that deſign is ſecret, and utterly unknown to all, till the promiſe it ſelf be apprehended by Faith, or finally rejected by unbelief. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 38.7,14. <hi>Ebed-mclech</hi> let down a Rope to draw <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> out of the dungeon by. The cords could never have pulled him up, unleſs the <hi>Prophet</hi> had put them under him, and unleſs his friend had drawn him up: He did ſo, and ventures on this mean of eſcape: He ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on the ſtrength of the cold, and on the truſtineſs of his friend; if either of them had failed him, he might have fallen down and broke his neck, or ſtuck ſtill in the mire, and ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Pit. The caſe is ſo here. The
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93776:27"/> promiſe of Salvation is a great ſecurity, but it is ſo only to them that caſt themſelves on it, and truſt to it. Whoever will truſt Gods promiſe in Chriſt, will find that it is able to bear all their weight, if it were never ſo great. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay this warm promiſe to thy cold heart, and by the Lords bleſſing, life and warmth will come in. Try the ſtrength of the promiſe, by caſting all thy burden on it, and it will never ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee, nor thou periſh by its failing. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians think that the promiſes of God are a <hi>bleſſed Charter</hi> (and ſo indeed they are) but few mind the promiſes as <hi>Gods tendered and offered ſecurity to men;</hi> whereby, as means he works faith in his choſen, and by the offer of them to all in the Goſpel, leaves unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unexcuſable. Sinners periſh under the Goſpel, not becauſe there is no cord of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion caſt out to them, but becauſe they either love the pit they are in; or cannot truſt Gods faithful promiſe of ſalvation by Chriſt, for their delivery.</p>
               <p>So much of the firſt thing, the proving that all ought to come to the Throne of Grace, or to <hi>God in Chriſt ſitting on it.</hi> God is not otherwiſe approachable, univerſal need of this Throne, and of the bleſſings given at it, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal call and command of God to come, an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal promiſe to all that do come; all prove that all men ſhould come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But though it be the Duty of all to come, yet but few do come; we would therefore ſee, <hi>who they he that will come to the Throne of Grace.</hi> Of ſuch we have two words.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:93776:27"/>
               <p n="1">1. Such as <hi>are given of the Father to the Son,</hi> all they, and they only, will come to this Throne of Grace. <hi>All that the Father giveth to me, ſhall come to me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt.</hi> John 6.37. <hi>Ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep.</hi> John 10.26. The high ſpring of all the effectual calling and coming of men to Chriſt is this, <hi>they that are ordained to eternal life believe,</hi> and none but they. It would be very unfit, that the Book of Life ſhould be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and read by any preacher of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. I think not that ever any <hi>Apostle</hi> had it opened to them, with reſpect to others, So that they ſhould be able, when looking on the multitude they preached to, to ſay, theſe are appointed for Eternal Life, and theſe paſt by. But they being happily in the dark as to this ſecret purpoſe of God, did offer ſalvation through Jeſus Chriſt to all that heard them. So <hi>Paul</hi> Acts 13.38,39,40. <hi>Be it known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, men and Brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which you could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes. Having told them this good news, he <hi>ver.</hi> 40.41. warns them. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware therefore leſt that come upon you which is ſpoken of in the Prophets, Behold ye deſpiſers, and wonder and periſh:</hi> after his repeated pains on them, its ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi> It was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere application of this word, that a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Divine made of it; that all the elect of God in this place, were gathered in, by <hi>Faul</hi>'s miniſtry in it, at this time. The grace of election is the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93776:28"/> ſpring of Faith. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. But this grace of Election is not ſeen, but in the gift and light of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All ſuch and only they will come to the throne of grace, that <hi>are drawn by the Father.</hi> John 6.44,45. <hi>No man can come to me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day. It is written in the Prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God: Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</hi> Obſerve here the two Univerſals. <hi>No man can come unleſs drawn, every man that is drawn, doth come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt decries the power of Nature, the latter advanceth the power of God's grace. The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Impotence of Nature, and Omnipotence of grace, in the buſineſs of Mans Salvation, are ſtumbling blocks to all the ungodly, but are foundations in Chriſtian Doctrine. The one lays Man in the duſt; the other raiſeth him on a new bottom of the grace of God. When God hath a mind to draw a ſinner to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to make him a Believer on him to Salvation; He teacheth him ſecretly and by a ſtrong hand, He whiſpers into his Heart, the excellency of the Saviour, and greatneſs of his Salvation, ſo, that ſurely the periſhing ſinner comes to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and as ſurely is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed and ſaved by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But <hi>who ſhall be welcome?</hi> Surely all that, come ſhall be welcome, as the word every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where wineſſeth, and all that ever tryed it have found and teſtifie it by their experience. For as the Son refuſed none that were given
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93776:28"/> him of the Father in their eternal Counſel, but took every one of them as his charge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them; ſo all they and only they being drawn by the Father, and made willing to come to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are made welcome by him. <hi>John</hi> 6.37. He knows his ſheep, when wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Mountains, <hi>John</hi> 10.16,27.28. and accordingly receives them: when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drives home the loſt Sheep to their great Shepherd, <hi>Chriſt</hi> knows them before he opens the fold to them, and becauſe he knows them, he lets them in, that they may find paſture, and feed on him and his grace to Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>But there are ſome that are ſpecially wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſpeed well at this throne of grace.</p>
               <p n="1">As. 1. They that come <hi>when they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe,</hi> they that come to the Throne of grace as their laſt ſhift. <hi>We know not what to do, but our eyes are upon thee,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaphat.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. Sincereſt believing, and ſtrongeſt believing, is acted, when a man hath no prop at all to lean upon, but God alone. Believing, is called fleing. <hi>We have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before us.</hi> Heb. 6.18. Now who flees? Only he that can ſtand no longer, that is not able to deal with his Adverſary and Danger, that hath no hope of prevailing by his ſtrength, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore betakes himſelf to his heels. It is mens great ſin to endeavour to ſeek that elſewhere, that only is to be found here, Mercy and Grace. But it's the greateſt Sin of all, to count all loſt, as long as this Throne ſtands, and the Lord calls men to come to it. Be deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,

               <p n="3">3. They are ſpecially welcome to the throne of grace that <hi>come to ſtay, reſolving never to leave it:</hi> That not only come to it at a pinch and ſtrait, but come to abide there. Our Lord teacheth ſeveral Parables, to encourage and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in plying the throne of grace. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.5,13. and <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1,8. <hi>Jacob</hi> was a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man, and knew well the manner of this Court: When he wreſtled with the <hi>Angel. Gen.</hi> 32.24.30. And that. <hi>Angel</hi> was the <hi>King of the Throne of Grace.</hi> Hoſ. 12.3,4,5. After a long nights wreſtling, with weeping and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications; ſaith the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.26. <hi>Let me go for the day breaketh. Jacob</hi> anſwers, <hi>I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me.

Can a man hold God, when he hath a mind to be gone? But <hi>Jacob</hi> knew his party, and percieved that he try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, if he would part without a bleſſing. <hi>Nay,</hi> ſaith Jacob, <hi>if thou ask my leave and conſent to part ſo, I will never give it, let the day break, and the next night come, the great Bleſſer, and lame halting</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſhall never part,

He had the Lords Bleſſing. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12,16. He got it renewed again on the Lords calling him to return to <hi>Canaan. Gen.</hi> 31.3. Yet he was in a new ſtrait, and wanted a new bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and wreſtled for it, and obtained it. Let all the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> imitate his practice, and they ſhall ſhare in his Bleſſing, and <hi>be fed with the heritage of</hi> Jacob <hi>their Father,</hi> as the word is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.14.</p>
               <p>In preſſing the Exhortation in the Text, I ſhall lay before you a few conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider the <hi>Greatneſs of this</hi> priviledge. That there is a throne of grace erected for ſinners, and revealed to them. This throne is only erected for ſinners: it had never been but for ſinners. A throne of grace, ſuppoſeth that there are guilty ſinners to ſtand before it, and to get good by it. The greatneſs of this priviledge is apparent, in comparing the State of fallen Man with that of fallen Angels: And in comparing their State that have the Goſpel, with theirs that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Compare the ſtate of <hi>fallen Man with that of falten Angels.</hi> Whatſoever the proper meaning of that word is. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Thou. hoſt made him a little lower than the Angels:</hi> theſe two may be well concieved; that Man in, his original make was lower in dignity than the Angels, and that Man was made a little after the Angels were made: And long after it could not be, for the whole Old Creation was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93776:30"/> finiſhed in ſix days. The Angels that fell are ſo ſinful and miſerable, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak any good of them. Yet in their firſt make, they were a very glorious part of the Creation. Notwithſtanding, when they ſinned, there was no throne of grace provided for them. <hi>God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.4. Yet for his Elect, he <hi>ſpared not his own Son.</hi> Rom. 8.32. The Devils (for ſuch ſin made them) immediatly upon their ſinning, were as much condemned as ever they ſhall be; I ſay not, as much executed, for it ſeems that their full torment is reſerved to the laſt day. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Art thou come to torment us before the time!</hi> Matth. 8.29. ſay they to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> No wonder the Devil be ſuch an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Goſpel of Man's Salvation, and a hater of the Throne of Grace. The wonder is, that men ſhould be deceived by Satan, to deſpiſe and ſlight this great priviledge. Let Chriſtians take a view of this aſtoniſhing appearance of Gods Grace, that <hi>fallen Angels are all paſt by,</hi> and <hi>fallen Men taken up;</hi> not indeed all of them, but a great many, as one day will declare. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>For verily he took not on him the nature of Angels; but he took on him the Seed of</hi> Abraham.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the greatneſs of this priviledge <hi>in the Revelation of it.</hi> You have it, but the greateſt part of the World have it not. They that cannot receive the Truth of God revealed in the word, about the Soveraignty of Grace in Election, and the Efficacy of diſtinguiſhing Grace in Calling, muſt ſee the ſame Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty acted in diſpenſing or witholding the means of Grace, as pleaſeth him. And to be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93776:31"/> utterly ignorant that there is a Throne of Grace, renders people as miſerable as if there was no Throne of Grace at all. They that never hear of <hi>Christ</hi> muſt periſh. It is an idle dream that the efficacy of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Death may be apply'd and profitable to the ſaving of adult perſons that never heard of him. There is no Salvation for Men but by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> there is no knowing of it or partaking of it, but by <hi>the word of Truth, the Goſpel of our Salvation</hi> Eph. 1.13. <hi>Christ</hi> and his name go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other;</hi> No Saviour but he. <hi>For there is none other name under heaven, given among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt be ſaved.</hi> No other way of getting good by him, but by hearing of his Name, and believing on his Name. <hi>How ſhall they believe on him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> Rom. 10.14. It is a wonderful Mercy to hear of Him: But Wo to them that hear and do not believe. None can believe without hearing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. But alas! many hear, and believe not. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the <hi>great advantages of this priviledge,</hi> of having a Throne of Grace erected for us, and revealed to us. All bleſſings may be had here, by coming for them. If there was ſuch a Throne in this world for Silver and Gold, and Health and outward Mercies, what ſtrange crowding would there be to it? The Bleſſings to be had here, are innumerable for multitude; <hi>All ſpiritual bleſſings in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. Bleſſings invaluable for their worth: <hi>Eternal</hi> in their duration, <hi>most free</hi> in their Tenure, and all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:93776:31"/> given in Love. Every act of favour from the throne of grace, is more worth than all God's common Mercies. <hi>Lord, lift up upon us the light of thy countenance. Pſal.</hi> 4.6,7. that will put joy into the ſoul. Every thing given at the throne of grace is a bleſſing of Grace. Its very name ſhould teach people how to come, and how to call what they get at it. If it be a throne of Grace, we ſhould come to it as empty needy Beggars, and when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve any thing there, we ſhould call and count it Grace. Ask all Saints on Earth, and they will witneſs that great and good things are to be had at the throne of grace: Try it your ſelves, and you will find it is not invain to beg here. Nay, the damned in Hell, do bear ſad witneſs that great are the bleſſings that are to be had at the throne of grace, which they feel and know by their woful and eternal loſs of them. The glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Heaven, know what a rich throne of grace this is. Only ſinners on earth will not believe this, nor uſe this throne as they ſhould.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that this Court and Throne <hi>is of ſhort continuance.</hi> It will not be kept up always. There is a limitation of the time of its laſting. As <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.7. <hi>He limiteth a certain day.</hi> The day of the continuance of the throne of grace, is bounded and limited with four days. The day of a <hi>mans life,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel day,</hi> the <hi>Worlds day,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The day of <hi>every mans life.</hi> This hath bounds ſet to it by God. <hi>Job</hi> 14.5. The throne of Grace continues unto men no longer than they live. When men die, they go not to the throne of grace, but of Glory and Judgment.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93776:32"/> If we have ſped well at the throne of grace, we ſhall be welcome to the throne of glory. The uncertainty and ſhortneſs of life, with the certainty of the expiring of all Treaties betwixt God and us about Salvation, at the end of Life, ſhould make people careful to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the main matter in Gods time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>Goſpel day;</hi> this is alſo ſet and limited by the Lord. He hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how many offers you ſhall have of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and when they come to an end, there will not be one more. And then the throne of grace is taken down, as to you. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42. <hi>If thou hadst known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace, but now they are hid from thine eyes,</hi> ſaith our Lord to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This was the ending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining day to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as a City, and to its Inhabitants as a Body, though many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons had another day of grace. Yet the ſlipping of that day, hangs on that poor people and their Poſterity to this very day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the <hi>Worlds day:</hi> and then the day of grace will end as to all, <hi>when the Bridegroom cometh, they that are ready enter with him to the marriage, and the door was ſhut.</hi> Matth. 25.10. There was no more grace to be diſpenſed to men; and we know not when that day will come. Miſerable is their caſe, who ſhall ſee <hi>Christ</hi> coming in the Clouds of Heaven, before they have ſeen him by Faith in the Goſpel; who heart the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God, before they have heard the quickning voyce of the Son of God from the throne of grace; who have neglected calling on him in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93776:32"/> time, and begin out of time. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25. <hi>When the Maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</hi> Is it not juſt that they ſhould be kept at the ſhut door, that would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at an open door in <hi>Christ</hi>'s time, and when he called? When <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes and hath ſhut the door, no man will be let in, knock as he will. Now while the throne of grace is patent, no man will be kept out, be what he will, that hath a mind to enter, and knocks for entrance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is the <hi>Spirits</hi> day. Here is a great depth of Gods Soveraignty and Wiſdom, a great depth of his Severity, an unaccountable and awful Judgment; how the Spirit of God ſtrives with men in the Goſpel, how near he comes to them ſometimes, how cloſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegeth them, that they ſeem to be on the point of yielding, and are not far from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and yet he draws back his hand and leaves them. I believe that many ungodly men, many reprobates, have been ſometimes in their life nearer to Heaven (if ſuch may be ſaid to be near to Heaven that never come there) then many an Elect perſon was half an hour before his Converſion. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man.</hi> What kind of ſtriving this was, and what became of them ſtriven with, we have. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19,20. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will more bitterly aggravate the eternal miſery of the Damned, than the remembrance of this, that they had a day, and in that day grace offered to them, and that they did reject
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:93776:33"/> the offer. Mens carnal hearts are now full of cavils againſt the unſearchable methods and ways of God towards the Sons of Men; but the laſt days Judgment will determine and declare, That in the perdition of the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there was, and is, moſt pure and unſpotted Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, and in the ſalvation of all the Elect, pure, perfect, and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant grace, that reigned in them, and over them, and through them, till it brought them to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſeeing the having of a throne of grace is a priviledge of ſo great importance, and of ſo uncertain continuance, there ſhould be the greater care to make diligent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent improvement of it. Why ſhould any man let this throne of Grace ſtand empty? Will men provoke the Lord to ſay, in vain have I ſet up a throne of grace for ſinners, that come not at it?</p>
               <p>Again conſider, the Wrath that will follow on the neglect, and not improving of this great priviledge. The Sin is many ways com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the judgments of many ſorts, that are inflicted. But I leave this to the next oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p>Except you in your perſonal exerciſe and experience do know what this throne of grace is, and what is got there; you may be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians hereafter, but as yet you are none, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you experience what this throne of grace is, by frequent repairing to it, and by frequent receiving good at it. That Man or Woman, whatever his or her name be in the world or the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that never
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93776:33"/> found any need for, or uſe of, or benefit by this throne of grace, is ſurely a dead ſinner. People may ſafely and ſurely judge of both the State and Frame of their Souls, by their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the throne of grace. Never got any Soul life, but by an act of grace and power from this throne. No Soul can be kept in life, but by daily entercourſe with it. Its as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that theſe Bodies of ours ſhould be maintained in life and ſtrength, without Meat and Drink and Air, as it is for the Soul of a Believer to proſper without daily plying the throne of grace.</p>
               <p>Let therefore the Exhortation in the Text be complyed with, come to this throne. Say therefore, Lord I am invited to come to the throne of thy grace, and none have more need of that grace than I, and there is enough of grace there for me; and therefore I will come and beg, and get, and abide, and bleſs the Giver, and become happy by Recieving.</p>

               <p>I Have ſpoke of the firſt thing that this Text contains. That God in Jeſus Chriſt, in the Goſpel is on a throne of grace, inviting men to come to him. What this throne of grace is, why all ſhould come, who they be that will come, and who will be ſpecially welcome, you have heard. I was preſſing this Exhortation of coming to this throne. You ſee the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in delivering this, takes in himſelf with them he exhorts. <hi>Let us come.</hi> He had oft come
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93776:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> before, and had been bountifully dealt with at this Court. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>And the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant</hi> towards him. This made him commend this Throne ſo highly, and entreat others, and ſtir up himſelf, to frequent addreſſes to it. I did uſe three Arguments to back this Exhortation, and ſhall add a fourth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Was the <hi>greatneſs of the priviledge</hi> of having a throne of grace to come unto. A pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge denyed to fallen Angels, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it denyed to the far greater part of Mankinde.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This throne of grace is a priviledge <hi>full of rich advantages.</hi> All Believers know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of them. All their acceptance with God, all their acceſs to God, all their communications from him, and fellowſhip with him, all their Bleſſings in time, and their hopes for Eternity, are all owing to this, that God is on a Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This priviledge is of <hi>uncertain duration,</hi> and ſhort. The Lord the King is for ever, but the Throne of Grace is not for ever: it is but a Time diſpenſation: and limited unto certain ſeaſons. The Goſpel day is uncertain, our life time is uncertain, the Worlds day is uncertain to us, though all determined by God. But above all, the Spirits day is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. How long he will ſtrive, when he will forbear, who can tell? Some godly men have thought, that there are few (if any) that live under a powerful Miniſtry, but at ſome time of their life, the Spirit of God comes cloſe to them, ſo that there is not only a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93776:35"/> witneſs given for the Lord in the offers of the Goſpel, but there is a further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to that witneſs, by ſome ſpecial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Gods Spirit to their hearts. But whatever there be in that obſervation, this is undoubted; that where the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> makes the ſtrongeſt aſſaults on men, if he be reſiſted and withdraws, the moſt prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hardneſs is left behind. Therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, bold, hardned ſinners, cruel Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, Apoſtates and Mockers of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, are uſually ſuch, as ſometimes were under ſpecial Conviction; not to ſpeak of the <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghost,</hi> which conſiſts in ſome high Rebellion againſt ſpecial workings of the Spirit of God on mens Conſciences under the Goſpel. This dreadful ſin, Satan perplexeth many Believers with fears of it: But its certain that a diſturbing fear of this guilt, is a proof of a perſons innocency as to it. For whoſoever have fallen into this Abyſs of wickedneſs, are ſo far from fearing the ſin (though they may have a hopeleſs fear of wrath, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26.) that they glory in it, therefore they are ſaid <hi>to do deſpite to the Spirit of Grace.</hi> Let all that find the Spirit ſtriving with them, take good heed to themſelves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his motions, and ſecure their ſtate ſpeedily, by believing on the <hi>Lord Jeſus;</hi> for the ſeaſon of his ſtriving is the moſt critical part of our life, and as it iſſues, of greateſt conſequence to Salvation or Damnation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Argument, I would conclude this point with, is the <hi>greatneſs of the ſin of not coming to the Throne of Grace, and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:93776:35"/> dreadful wrath it draws on.</hi> This ſin is many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Whilſt Grace and Mercy, that men have no ſenſe nor experience of, are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, and therefore the Throne of Grace, where only they are to be had, is deſpiſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. The Spirit of God in the Scripture, is at much pains to commend the Worth and Value of the Bleſſings that <hi>Christ</hi> came to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and hath to diſpenſe, and to prefer them above all preſent ſenſible things; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the bright light of the Word dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily in mens eyes, the droſs and dung of this World is more precious in the eyes, and ſavory to the heart, of every ungodly man, than all the Grace given on Earth, and all the Glory to be given in Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:93776:36"/>
               <p n="2">2. This ſin of not coming, is committed by <hi>delaying to come.</hi> The call of God is, <hi>Let us come:</hi> The anſwer of many hearts is, <hi>Let us delay to come.</hi> Whence think you that theſe delays come? We have it daily to bewail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and you, that a multitude will come together to hear, and do ſo day by day; yet all that can be ſaid to them, from their childhood to their old Age, never prevailed with many of them, to ſpend one hour in ſerious treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Throne of Grace, with God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the eternal Salvation of their Souls. It is undeniable that ye are but a pack of groſs Hypocrites, if you attend on the means of grace in the Aſſemblies of Saints, and yet have no particular perſonal errand to the Throne of Grace, for your own Souls. The Salvation of the Soul is not carried on in a crowd. The Grace of God muſt be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly applyed to you, and you muſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly apply it to your ſelves, and your ſelves to the Throne of Grace, if ever you be ſaved. The fellowſhip of Saints was never ordained for this end, to render perſonal applications to God needleſs; and it is groſly abuſed when it is ſo perverted. It is impoſſible that a perſon can have any true fellowſhip with Saints in any ordinance of God, unleſs he have particular buſineſs at the Throne of Grace for himſelf. He hath indeed no true Religion, whoſe all of Religion is in Company and in Publick. Yet we ſee how backward many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors are to this perſonal treating with God; how many ſhifts and delays they make. To ſuch I ſay, would it not be a terror to you, if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93776:36"/> either God or Man, or Angels, or the Devil, ſhould tell you this day, that from this time to your dying day, you ſhall never have lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor heart, nor time, to ſpend one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour in dealing with God for your eternal Salvation! Would not this be terrible to you? But the ſame dreadful thing is daily done by mens delays. The call of God is <hi>to day,</hi> you ſay <hi>to morrow;</hi> when <hi>to morrow</hi> comes, then you ſay <hi>next day;</hi> when that comes, you put it ſtill farther off. This you may be ſure of, that whatever is the true ſpring and cauſe of delays in this matter, will ſtill remain and gather ſtrength, unleſs the Grace of God come in. Men deceive themſelves with vain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; but the true ſpring of all delays in treating in earneſt with God, at the Throne of Grace, is Unbelief and Unwillingneſs; and the more they are indulged by delaying, the ſtronger they grow. <hi>Therefore the Holy Ghost</hi> ſaith, <hi>to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> Heb. 3.7,8. See how the Spirit of God fixeth an oppoſition betwixt theſe two, <hi>preſent hearing,</hi> and <hi>preſent harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and a conjunction betwixt theſe two, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not hearing,</hi> and <hi>hardening.</hi> If there is preſent hearing, there is no preſent hardening: if not, there is. The refuſal given to the <hi>to days</hi> call of God, hardens the heart againſt <hi>to morrows</hi> call. O that men dreaded delays as moſt perillous things, and the cauſe of the everlaſting ruine of multitudes under the Goſpel!</p>

But let ſuch know that there is Hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this thing. Only come and ſee, and try what may be done. Beware of deſpair; it is the Devils ſin; but he hath reaſon for it, for he is condemned, and all doors of hope are eternally ſhut upon him, or rather none was ever opened to him. But for a man, that hath the riches of Gods long-ſuffering, forbearance and patience (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.) daily laid out upon him, that hath the door of grace ſet open to him, and the Lord calling, entreating, promiſing acceptance on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93776:37"/> his coming, for ſuch a man to give over all hope, is a ſin ſome way worſe than the Devils, a frame pleaſing only to the Devil, moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to God, and his Son <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (I do not call it <hi>the ſin againſt the Holy Ghost.</hi>) A reflection on all the glorious appearances and manifeſtations of the Throne of Grace, and moſt ſurely damning, if continued in. Away with it ſpeedily; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thy caſe is not deſperate, and if you cannot ſhake it off, come to the Throne of Grace and complain of it. If ye can but ſee the Throne and him that ſits upon it, deſpair will vaniſh as a Night-Owl on the bright ſhining of the Sun of Righteouſneſs. Deſpair cannot live in the preſence of the glorious grace of <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> Come then and ſee, and lay hold on the hope ſet before you. The other Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers to come, are the <hi>Diſcouraged;</hi> they do not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair that their caſe cannot be mended, but they ſee ſo much and ſo many things out of Order, that their hearts fail them in applying to the only Remedy. In the time of their Carnal Security, and Ignorance of God and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (that bred and kept up that Security) they could ruſh into Gods preſence without fear, and call and count all the bleſſings of the Covenant theirs, without any doubt, and yet without any ground: But when God begun to deal with them, and to come cloſe to them, and to ſend in light and life into their Conſciences, then they ſee their former miſtakes; they ſee their utter want and great need of thoſe bleſſings, they once dreamed they were rich in the poſſeſſion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93776:38"/> of; they ſee their utter unworthineſs of them, and therefore find it hard to believe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Lord will welcome them to the Throne of his Grace. Uſually beginners in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity have greater light and ſenſe as to their neceſſity of ſaving Grace and Mercy, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lords willingneſs to give them. And this is the ſeaſon wherein Satan doth uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally come in (if permitted, and often he is) with his Temptations and fiery darts, that they felt nothing of, while they were in his Kingdom and power of darkneſs. To ſuch I would propoſe 3 things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is the <hi>ground</hi> of thy diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Hereto I know they will ſay a great deal, and it may be more than is true. I grant all can be ſaid to be true. But the ſum of all is, I am a great ſinner and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſerable. Be humbled as low as Hell in the ſenſe thereof, yet be not diſcouraged. What is in thy caſe, but what is common? only thou ſees and feels for thy ſelf, and ſo did others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is the <hi>tendency</hi> of it? doth it tend to keep thee aloof from the Throne of Grace? it is then of Satan.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What can be the <hi>cure</hi> of it. You would not be always in this heartleſs frame: how think you to get it removed? By keeping ſtill from the Throne of Grace? Will, or can, any ſpiritual plagues be cured, but by Chriſt the Phyſician? Or any ſpiritual Bleſſing be got, but at his door? Can you expect it without coming and begging? <hi>David</hi> took the right courſe with his fainting heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.5.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93776:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> He <hi>challengeth</hi> his Soul for its diſquietment, He <hi>chargeth</hi> it to truſt in God; and becauſe he had not prevailed with his Soul, he brings it to God by Faith. <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>O my God, my Soul is caſt down within me.</hi> Do ye ſo, and call upon him by that name, <hi>God that comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thoſe that are caſt down.</hi> 2 Cor. 7.6.</p>
               <p>I ſhall name no more of the ways this ſin is acted, then theſe three, <hi>deſpiſing, delaying,</hi> and <hi>refuſing.</hi> Several other Expreſſions there are of this ſin in the Word; but if you be kept from theſe three, you <hi>are innocent from the great Tranſgreſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What is the Wrath revealed from Heaven, for this Great ſin of not coming to the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God teſtifies his Diſpleaſure againſt this ſin, by <hi>taking away of his Goſpel;</hi> nothing is more juſt with God, then, that when his Grace is ſlighted, the means of Grace ſhould be removed. If the Lord argue ſo as to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? Ye will revolt more and more:</hi> much more may he argue thus, Why ſhould I keep up a Throne of Grace any longer? You will but deſpiſe it more and more. <hi>Chriſt</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſad parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.33. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and makes a juſt, but dreadful application of it to the hearers. <hi>ver.</hi> 43. <hi>Therefore I ſay unto you, the Kingdom of God</hi> (another name of the Throne of Grace) <hi>ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> They were <hi>cut off for their unbelief.</hi> Rom. 11.20. With what face can an unbeliever beg of God the continuance of the means of Grace,

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of thoſe means? A general contempt of the Grace of God, enfeebleth the Spirit, of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Chriſtians, in ſtanding before the Lord for the continuance of the Goſpel, with a people that uſe it not. This dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been often threatned in the Word, and inflicted in the ſevere Providence of God, on many once famous Churches and Nations. As the Lord ſaith, <hi>But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it for the wickedneſs of my people Iſrael.</hi> Jer. 7.12. So may I ſay, go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Seven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> go to <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a famous Church was planted, and learn to fear for your ſelves. Not to ſpeak of later deſolations in ours and our Fathers days. The Lords removing of his Goſpel is a judgment that is very deep: As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the ſame ſubject. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. We may take notice of this judgment as brought on by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing errors in and about the foundation, <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> or by gradual Apoſtaſie and Impurity of Converſation in Profeſſors; or by the rage of perſecution, <hi>wearing out the Saints of the most High.</hi> Dan. 7.25. But yet we have good grounds from the word of God, to believe and hope, that the Goſpel may be ſecured to a Generation, ordinarily, if they be careful to get the bleſſing thereof, and to walk worthy of it. If the grace of God its ſelf be prized, the means of grace will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:93776:39"/>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord witneſſeth his diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſlighters of his grace, by fearful <hi>outward Judgments.</hi> So far'd it with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Lords prediction. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42,43,44. It hath been a Remark of wiſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers of the Providence of God towards Nations, ſince the Reformation from Popery, that in thoſe places where the greateſt light of the Goſpel hath ſhined, there the greateſt judgments have been inflicted. As in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and amongſt our ſelves in <hi>Brittain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord viſits for this ſin with <hi>ſpiritual judgments,</hi> the moſt wrathful diſpenſations of God on this ſide Hell. As <hi>hardneſs of heart, blindneſs of mind, ſearedneſs of Conſcience, vileneſs of affections;</hi> Judgments, which they that are under, never feel nor complain of, nor will be convinced of, though they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſible to others. If the Lord inflict them on the Heathen for their abuſe of the dim light of Nature. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21,24,26,28. How much greater are ſuch that are ſent for the abuſe of the light of the Goſpel? That dreadful Commiſſion given to the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ch. 6.9,10. is often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and fulfilled in the New Teſtament. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.14. and <hi>John</hi> 12.39,40. <hi>Therefore they could not believe</hi> (their ſin was, <hi>v.</hi> 37. they <hi>believed not on him;</hi> here is their plague, <hi>they could not believe</hi>) <hi>becauſe that</hi> Eſaias <hi>ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts,</hi> that they ſhould <hi>not ſee with their eyes, nor underſtand with their hearts, and be converted, and I ſhould heal them, Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies

The Intereſt and Influence of God in ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Judgments, is a great depth: They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways juſt, and always deep; and dreadful are their effects: They on whom they fall, feel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſee nothing, fear nothing. So that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68 35. <hi>O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places.</hi> But ſuch as have a Heart to the Grace of God, and would fain be bleſſed thereby, need not fear thoſe Judgments, and ſhall never feel them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, The Wrath of God againſt ſuch as come not to the throne of grace, is engraven in <hi>the ſingular vengeance of eternal Ruine.</hi> There is ſomething ſingular in their Hell. The Law ſends all unpardoned Sinners to a Law-Hell. The Lord ſend Deſpiſers of ſaving grace, to a ſpecial Hell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. and 10.29. A much <hi>ſorer puniſhment.</hi> No Quarters in Hell are tolerable; yet our Lord ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.22,24. <hi>That it ſhall be more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for Tyre and Sidon, Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, then for the Cities where he preaehed, and wrought mighty works.</hi> We ſhould be thankful for this fair warning.

They were Sinners before, but the Contempt of that Diſpenſation of grace that Chriſt brought to them, rendered them ſingular Tranſgreſſors.

What is the Condemnation? <hi>Light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> The Law condemns them becauſe their Deeds are evil: The deſpiſed Goſpel condemns them, becauſe they refuſe the only Remedy. Law-Sin is poyſon to the Soul, and kills as ſuch. Unbelief is rejecting the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Antidote, and kills as ſuch. Look to one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>But thoſe mine Enemies, that would not that I ſhould reign over them,

               <p>Thus having opened the firſt Head in the Text, That there is a throne of grace erected and revealed in the Goſpel, to which Men are invited to come, I ſhall only apply it in two Queſtions, and the Lord apply them to your Conſciences, and make them give a right and true Anſwer: They are two ſhort plain ones. 1. Have you come. 2. Will ye come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Have you come to the throne of grace?</hi> Do you know and are ſure that you have come? As <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 6.68,69. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch comers. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. <hi>But ye are come to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that ſpeaketh better things than that of Abel.</hi> You are all <hi>Hearers</hi> of the throne of grace; many are <hi>Talkers</hi> of it, and ſome <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters</hi> and <hi>Contenders</hi> about this throne; but are you <hi>Comers</hi> to it? Is your Heart on it, your Buſineſs at it, and your daily exerciſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it? You are in the outward Court; Doth that ſatisfie you? Alas! many poor Souls die and periſh there. To help to ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, how is it with you as to this, I would ask,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Have you come to the throne of grace? Then you <hi>have ſeen the King.</hi> He is a poor ſorry Courtier, that goes to Court every day, and never ſeeth the King's Face. As <hi>Abſolom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.24,28. Alas! many live in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> all their days, and never ſee the King that dwells in <hi>Zion.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> was brought to the throne of grace, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was revealed in him and to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15,16. When Men
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93776:42"/> are brought and come to the throne of grace, they receave <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. There is a <hi>ſeeing of him,</hi> joined with <hi>believing on him, John</hi> 6.40. All that ſee <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt have Eyes from him to ſee him with. <hi>The Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him, that enlightens the Eyes of mens <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Eph.</hi> 1.17,18. His <hi>Eye-Salve</hi> can only make blind Sinners <hi>to ſee, Rev.</hi> 3.18. Are Men in doubt whether they have ſeen <hi>Chriſt</hi> or not? Whence doth it proceed? Is <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo mean, and dark, and ordinary an Object, that Men may ſee him, and not know that they ſee him? A Man may doubt whether his Eyes take up a dim cloudy Star in a dark night: But the Sun doth not ſhine, or the Man is blind, if he lift up his Face, and doubt whether he ſee the Sun at noon day. There is a Manifeſtation of Chriſt promiſed, <hi>John</hi> 14.21,23. which, when made by him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved by his people, removeth all Doubtings, ſo that the Soul muſt ſay, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>This is our God, this is the Lord.</hi> But this meaſure is not ordinary, nor conſtantly to be expected. Is there any like unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> Are any of his Companions, as they are called, <hi>Song.</hi> 1.7. ſo like to him, that a Believer cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the difference? Never did a Man ſee <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> by the Eye of Faith, but he is by that ſight of him, perſwaded that there is none to be compared with him. No Man is converted and made a believer, but by a Revelation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> A Man may be awakened with a view of God's Glory; he may be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:93776:42"/> by a ſight of Sin and Hell; and may be <hi>rouſed</hi> out of his ſleep of ſecurity, by the thunders of <hi>Sinai;</hi> but he is never <hi>converted, and made a Chriſtian,</hi> but by a Revelation of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as glorious in his Robes of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Whence then is it that all Believers on him, do not own his manifeſting himſelf to them, and their ſeeing of him? It is in part, from the weakneſs of their ſight, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the glory of him they ſee, and their ſtrong deſire to ſee him better. But for ſuch as have ſpent their days about the throne of grace, and yet never ſaw <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and the Glory of God in his Face as a Saviour, ſo as to diſgrace all things in compariſon with him, ſo as to raiſe deſires after more of him, and ſo as to fill their Hearts with Love, Wonder, and Praiſe, ſuch have been at the Court, but have not ſeen the King on his Throne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are you come to the throne of grace? <hi>What made you come? what Errand did you come upon?</hi> No Man comes without an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. We need not make and ſeek one; we have enow at hand, if we would but uſe them. What Wants felt you at home? And what of his Fulneſs was taking with you? Can you ſay, I have a naked filthy Soul, and I am aſhamed to look on it, but how well would the Robe of his Righteouſneſs fit and adorn it? I am empty of all Good, and he is full of all Grace, on purpoſe to fill periſhing Souls, and I come for a ſhare thereof. The Bleſſing of many ready to periſh hath come upon him, and I come for his rich Salvation, and would leave my poor, but eternal Bleſſing on him.

Have you not got at this throne, a word of Promiſe that hath fed and feaſted thy Faith? <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Thy Words were found, and I did eat them, and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoycing of mine heart, for I am called by thy Name, O Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> Have you not ſometimes got the Door of Faith opened, and the Eye of Faith ſharpened, that ye could ſee within the Vail, and behold the good Land, and the bleſſed Lord of it, and thy happy Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in both? Let not this Throne be diſparaged
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:93776:44"/> both by the true emptineſs of Hypocrites, that are about it, rather than at it, and by the peeviſhneſs of real Believers. There are no poor Courtiers at this Court; they are all rich, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. They are only <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> but not ſo poor as they think, for a <hi>Kingdom is theirs,</hi> that is better than all Kingdoms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.3. The World count Believers poor, becauſe they ſee they often have not outward Riches, and they are blind and cannot ſee their ſpiritual Riches in Poſſeſſion and Reverſion. The Believer thinks himſelf poor, becauſe he ſeeth not all he hath in Poſſeſſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21,23. and becauſe he would ſo fain have all he hath a right to. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12.14. and the hope of. Or becauſe his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are hid, or his Eyes are dim, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Q. Will ye come?</hi> All is ready: Come to this Throne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.4. If ye have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come, begin juſt now: If ye have come often, come more often, and come better, come nearer and cloſer ſtill. Is there any thing wanting in you? Come, for all ſupply is here. Are you guilty? Come for Pardon: Many drawn Pardons are at this Court, drawn up ſweetly by free Grace, ſealed with the Blood of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> Come to this Throne, and add your Seal of Faith to one for your ſelf, and it ſhall be a Charter for Glory to you, lying warm at your Heart as long as you live, and will be your Paſs-port at death. But becauſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words of the Apoſtle in this verſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Arguments for coming, I ſay the leſs now.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:93776:45"/>
               <p>So much for the firſt Head of Doctrine in the Text.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Head is, How we ſhould come to this throne of grace. Come <hi>boldly,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi>'s Pen.</p>
               <p>The Point I would ſpeak to from it, is this:</p>
               <p>That <hi>there is a Boldneſs in Mens approaching to the Throne of Grace, that is allowed and commanded.</hi> For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not only mention it as a Priviledge allowed, but as a Duty or Frame injoined and commanded. So that he that comes not with this Boldneſs, not only ſits down ſhort of his Allowance, but ſins in diſobeying a plain Command. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is ſpoke of in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>In whom</hi> (ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as ver. 11.) <hi>we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence, by the faith of him.</hi> In <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19.22. both the Priviledge is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and the Improvement of it command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in <hi>drawing near with full aſſurance of Faith,</hi> and that to <hi>the holieſt of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On this Point I would ſhew, 1. What this Boldneſs is, that is allowed in approaching to the throne of grace. 2. What are the Grounds of this Boldneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is the Boldneſs allowed in coming to the throne of grace. There is a Boldneſs that is not allowed, and that I would warn you of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a Boldneſs of <hi>Ignorance and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence.</hi> When Men come into God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and neither know him, nor themſelves, nor the Matters they think they come about; ſuch are <hi>Fools, that conſider not that they do
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93776:45"/> evil, nor remember that he is in Heaven, and they upon Earth,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.1,2. <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the Aſſembly of the Saints; and to be had in reverence of all that are about him,</hi> Pſal. 89.7. This Boldneſs is forbidden, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Boldneſs of <hi>Peremptorineſs,</hi> that is not allowed to any Man, not to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever himſelf. People may, and do often, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get themſelves; as we uſe to ſay, <hi>too much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity breeds Contempt.</hi> Condeſcenſions from Superiours, oft make Inferiours forget their place. The Lord deals ſo graciouſly with his People, hears their Prayers readily, ſtoops low to them in his Love and Pity, that unleſs they watch and keep a Guard on their Spirits, they may ſoon fall into the Sin of being too ſaucy and peremptory with God.</p>
               <p>The firſt Prayer in the Bible, made by the greateſt Believer in the World, <hi>Abraham,</hi> is upon a moſt condeſcending appearance of God to him: The <hi>Son of God</hi> in humane ſhape, becomes <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Gueſt at Meat, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. Some think that <hi>Chriſt</hi> reſpects this appearance in <hi>John</hi> 8.56. <hi>Your Father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> He gives him the laſt Promiſe of a Son, with a determination of the preciſe time of its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. He deals with him as a Friend (and ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> is called, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.8. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.23. But all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are called Friends by <hi>Chriſt, John</hi> 15.14,15.) and after a great Commendation of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the Lord tells him his purpoſe of wrath againſt <hi>Sodom, ver.</hi> 17. to <hi>ver.</hi> 22. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93776:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> are ſent to execute the Vengeance, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſtands before the Lord to plead for Mercy. With what Boldneſs and Reverence doth he plead? The more the Lord ſtoops in condeſcending to his Petitions, the more low doth <hi>Abraham</hi> lye before him. He neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Lord's Majeſty, nor his own Meanneſs, and expreſſeth again and again, a holy Fear of offending by his renewed Suits, <hi>ver.</hi> 27, 30, 31, 32. I would have you conſidering this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Prayer, becauſe it is the firſt record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word, and becauſe it was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently managed by the Father of the Faithful. So <hi>Gideon</hi> prays in <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.39. <hi>And Gideon ſaid unto God, Let not thine anger be hot againſt me, and will ſpeak but this once.</hi> I am afraid that many ſincere <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are guilty of this Peremptorineſs: The Lord hath been ſo conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to them, that they become too peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory about ſome Particulars. Beware of it, and ſee how the Lord hath dealt with his People, and the beſt of them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.6,7,8. See <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Lot in this Matter. He had often ſought of God, and prevailed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23. <hi>Therefore the Lord ſaid, that he would deſtroy them, had not Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, his choſen, ſtood before him in the Breach, to turn away his Wrath, leſt he ſhould deſtroy them.</hi> A Man to whom God ſpake Face to Face, a Man to whom God ſpake ſo amazing Words, <hi>Let me alone, that my Wrath may wax hot againſt them,</hi> Exod. 32.10. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.20. <hi>I have pardoned according to thy word.</hi> Yet even this <hi>Moſes</hi> in a ſmall matter, for Life, to croſs <hi>Jordan,</hi> and to ſee the promiſed Land, hath this Anſwer, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Let it ſuffice thee,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93776:46"/> ſpeak no more unto me of this matter. Samuel</hi> is check'd alſo in a ſmall matter, that had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed for far greater, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.1. <hi>How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, ſeeing I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him?</hi> A Caſe may be ſuch, <hi>that though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before the Lord, they ſhould not prevail,</hi> Jer. 15.1. It is the only Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be always heard, <hi>John</hi> 11.42. Yet he in his Agony, pray'd ſo as to teach us to beware of this ſinful Boldneſs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. <hi>If it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Believers muſt remember, that in all Caſes they muſt deal humbly, and in ſome Caſes they muſt take Denyals Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is the boldneſs of <hi>preſumption,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is like Faith in appearance, but in reality it is very unlike it. Preſumption works this way, the Preſumer may have the <hi>mercy</hi> in his eye, but he hath no <hi>promiſe</hi> in his eye. Take heed to this. If there be ſtrong deſires after a mercy, and that mercy not pleaded for as in the promiſe, there is a ſpice of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that pleading. The reaſon why Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ask ſo great things of God, is becauſe God hath promiſed ſo great things to them. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27. Hence it is that preſumption acts ordinarily in pleading with God, not for the main ſpiritual bleſſings, but for ſome outward mercy that their hearts may be too much ſet upon. It is about ſuch, that Believers ſhould watch againſt this preſumptuous boldneſs. But if the pleading at the Throne of Grace, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Salvation and ſpiritual Bleſſings, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93776:47"/> betwixt Faith and Preſumption appears in this. Preſumption can never plead with God neither in deep diſtreſs, nor in the view of ſin. But it is the excellent property of Faith, that it can plead with God in both caſes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.3. <hi>Iniquities prevail againſt me; but as for our tranſgreſſions, thou ſhalt purge them away.</hi> Spoken like a Believer; and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3,4. <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldeſt mark iniquities, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> But can <hi>David</hi> ſtand! Yes, and he ſtands on this ground, <hi>But there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with thee, that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> There is juſt cauſe to ſuſpect that there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in that Mans heart, when his Boldneſs is only kept up, when ſin is out of ſight, and diſappears. A Believer believes moſt humbly, and often moſt ſtrongly, when his Sinfulneſs and Unworthineſs is beſt ſeen: For true Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith is not ſupported by any good and worth in us, but by what is in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The boldneſs of Faith cannot be entertained with <hi>regarding of iniquity in the heart. Pſal.</hi> 66.18. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20. Yet it can, with the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and ſeeing of Iniquity in both heart and life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24,25. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. But of this furder from the next head, of the Boldneſs of Faith; I now touch it only as it differs from the preſumptuous Boldneſs that is allowed to none. Again, Faith can ſtand under that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, that breaks the back of Preſumption. <hi>Job</hi> 13.15,16. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him; but I will maintain mine own ways before him. He alſo ſhall be my Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for an Hypocrite ſhall not come before him, He hath taken away my Children all at once,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93776:47"/> my Eſtate in one day, hath taken away my health, and made me miſerable, to a Proverb in all Ages; although he ſhould proceed and ſlay me with his own hand, my ſlayer is my Saviour, my death ſhall be my Salvation.</hi> Great words and hard to be ſpoken in the day of heavy tryal, God ſlaying <hi>Job,</hi> is <hi>Job</hi>'s Salvation. God ſlays, <hi>Job</hi> truſts, and maintains his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence under the ſtroke. No Hypocrite can do this, and many Believers do but bungle at the doing of it. There is an extremity, a coming on every man, that will try and diſcover what mettle there is in his Faith, Prepare for it.</p>
               <p>What then is the Boldneſs allowed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the throne of grace? It muſt not be an <hi>ignorant, peremptory</hi> or <hi>preſumptuous</hi> boldneſs. What muſt it then be?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is only the <hi>Boldneſs of Faith. Eph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Heb.</hi>10.19. The Boldneſs of Faith hath this in general in it, that it is grounded and bottomed on ſomewhat without a man, and on nothing in him. It is grounded on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as we ſhall hear further. It is a great miſtake in <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to think, that they cannot come to the throne of grace with Boldneſs, becauſe of the many Infirmities in their Hearts and in their Addreſſes. Your complaint may be juſt and true, but the Inference is not good. Do you never in your counting your Infirmities, put in this great one amongſt them in your Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the want of Boldneſs of Faith? For this Boldneſs ſtands not in any thing in us, and done by us: We muſt not come boldly, becauſe we can pray well, and plead hard; we muſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93776:48"/> not think to be heard in Heaven, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our <hi>much ſpeaking,</hi> nor <hi>well ſpeaking, Matth.</hi> 6.7. as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did. The bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith hath a higher and more noble and firm Foundation, even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe with theſe three Acts of this allowed and commanded Boldneſs of Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Believe firmly that the Throne of Grace is erected for poor empty ſinful Creatures, juſt ſuch as you be.</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the Law, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>It is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient;</hi> ſo may we ſay of the throne of grace, it is not made, framed and revealed for the holy and happy, but for miſerable Creatures that want <hi>Mercy,</hi> and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful helpleſs Creatures that want <hi>Grace.</hi> By what is diſpenſed here, we may know for whom, and for what ſort of Folks it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd and erected.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Believe firmly, that coming to the Throne of Grace by you, is allowed and commanded by the Lord.</hi> Say confidently, while I am coming to the throne of grace for Mercy and Grace, I am in the Work that the Lord would have me to be in. Take in all Diſcoveries you have made unto you, or that you can find out by ſearching, of the Weakneſs and Infirmities that are in your way of addreſſing to it, own them humbly, but maintain this ſtedfaſtly, that though you cannot <hi>do as you would,</hi> as <hi>others do,</hi> nor <hi>as you are bid,</hi> that yet you are doing <hi>what ye are bid.</hi> They are called, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.21. <hi>Who are the poor and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind!</hi> See a Promiſe looking that way,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93776:48"/> 
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.8.9. Now, may not the halt and maimed be confident, that they are coming, when called, although they cannot go ſo faſt and ſtraight as others do? Every Believer <hi>walks in the ſteps of the Faith of Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.12. though not his Pace. When you draw near to the throne of grace, aſſure your Hearts you are in your Duty, though many do it better than you do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Believe firmly that upon coming you ſhall ſpeed.</hi> This is coming with the boldneſs of Faith. We ſhould not come with a <hi>may be the Lord will be gracious:</hi> It's true, that in ſome particulars not abſolutely promiſed, nor ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply needful to Salvation, this <hi>may be,</hi> is all we can have, or ſhould ſeek. But in addreſſing for Saving Mercy and Grace, people ſhould come expecting Succeſs. It had been a cold Word, if it had been ſaid, <hi>Let us come to the Throne of Grace, it may be we ſhall obtain Mercy and find Grace.</hi> No, the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another Dialect, <hi>Let us come that we may obtain:</hi> Never doubt of obtaining if you come. I ſay not that the confidence of good Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment at this Throne is common to all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to it: But only that it is the Duty of all that come for God's Mercy and Grace in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> to perſwade their Hearts that they ſhall obtain and find it; and good grounds there are for it, as we ſhall hear.</p>
               <p>How is it with you, <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> you often come to this Throne: What are the Thoughts of your Hearts as to the iſſue of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes? It may be you think it is well if you can reach ſo far as this, <hi>It may be the Lord
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93776:49"/> will receave and welcome me, and therefore I will try.</hi> Though there is often Faith lurking under ſuch doubtings, and though a <hi>may be</hi> ſhould ſtir up Men to come; yet this is far from the boldneſs of Faith, which glorifies this Throne, and him that ſitteth on it, and which is ſo becoming and profitable to all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it. See how an <hi>Old Teſtament-Saint</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 23.3,6. <hi>O that I knew where I might find him; that I might come even to his Seat</hi> (that is this Throne) <hi>I would order my cauſe before him, and fill my mouth with Arguments.</hi> But cannot God eaſily ſtop this Man's Mouth? and bring Arguments againſt <hi>Job,</hi> that he could not anſwer? Yes ſurely, he can, but he will not. <hi>Will he plead againſt me with his great power? No; but he will put ſtrength in me.</hi> He that I plead with, will help me to plead and prevail. Few <hi>Christians know</hi> how much Glory is given to God, by an enlarged Heart filled with believing expectations of good from him; and how a Heart thus enlarged by Faith, is fitted and diſpoſed for receaving a large Bleſſing We eaſily conceave how ſharp Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Thirſt, ſtrong Deſires, deep ſenſe of Need, and mighty Pleadings and Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do prepare the way for great Receav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but we little think, how much force is in the bare-like Argument of Faith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Preſerve me, O God, for in thee do I put my truſt,</hi> Pſal. 33.22. <hi>Let thy merey, O Lord, be upon us, according as we hope in thee,</hi> Pſal. 57.1. <hi>Be merciful unto me, O God, be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto me, for my Soul truſteth in thee.</hi> There is a mighty force in ſuch Pleadings of Faith.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93776:49"/> 
                  <hi>I know no help but in and with thee, I expect it from thee, and therefore beg it of thee.</hi> Faith in a Believer never roſe ſo high, but the Lord's gracious Anſwer went higher, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.20. Look well to your Faith, Believers, raiſe it high, uſe it well, and plead by it, and plead upon it. Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> will never caſt that Soul into Hell, that cannot forbear to entertain in his Heart an expectation of eternal Life from him, in the Virtue of his precious Blood, and on the Warrant of his gracious Promiſe. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him ſhall never be confounded.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any, neither ſhall you, if you believe. It was a great Word of Faith, ſpoke by a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, who had been converted in a ſingular way, betwixt his Condemnation and Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of whom Mr. <hi>Fleming</hi> ſpeaks in the <hi>Fulfilling of the Scriptures;</hi> his laſt Words were theſe, ſpoke with a mighty ſhout, <hi>Never Man pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with his Face towards ſweet</hi> Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>

                  </gap>ers to this Name, that are guilty of the utter neglect of this Duty. Since it is a Duty of ſo great importance, it is needful to know how to manage it aright. This verſe gives us a great <hi>Directory,</hi> how to perform in a right manner this great Duty. 1. It tells
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93776:50"/> us whether to come: To a <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi> 2. How we ſhould come: <hi>With boldneſs.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God may many ways miſcarry; if not made to the true God, God in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> if not in the right manner.

               </p>
               <p>On this I propoſed two things to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. 1. What is the Nature of this <hi>allowed Boldneſs.</hi> 2. What Grounds are for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. On the Nature of this Boldneſs, I began to ſpeak laſt day, and did mainly inſiſt on the <hi>Negative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it follows to ſpeak of the <hi>Poſitive.</hi> It is the <hi>boldneſs of Faith</hi> that is allowed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded here, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. Faith is a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Grace, both in its Original, in its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and in its Actings and Exerciſe. It is the meaneſt and loweſt of all Graces (every Grace brings ſomewhat conſiderable; <hi>Love</hi> brings a <hi>flaming Heart, Repentance</hi> bring a <hi>bleeding Heart, Obedience</hi> brings a <hi>working Hand, Patience</hi> brings a <hi>broad Back</hi> for the <hi>Smiter,</hi> but Faith brings only an <hi>empty Heart and Hand,</hi> to be filled with borrowed and gifted Bleſſings.) And yet Faith is the <hi>higheſt and loftieſt Grace;</hi> it cannot reſt till it be in at the Heart and Love of God in Chriſt. Faith (if I may ſo ſpeak) can both be in Heaven and Hell at the ſame time. The Believer looking <hi>on himſelf, as in himſelf</hi> (the Apoſtle's diſtinction. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>our ſelves, as of our ſelves</hi>) judgeth himſelf to the Pit of Hell, as his deſerved Lot; but when he looks on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as in Chriſt, he ſits high, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5,6.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93776:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> and <hi>makes bold to enter into the Holieſt of all,</hi> Heb. 10.19. How many contrary Sentiments of himſelf doth a Believer expreſs! only ſalved from being Contradictions, by this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Word reveals, and Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves. <hi>I know that in me dwells no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. How! no good thing in a Man full of the Holy Ghoſt, a Man rich in the Grace of Chriſt! A Man that <hi>had laboured more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly than all the twelve Apoſtles!</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>Yea,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in me, that is, in my Fleſh, dwells no good thing.</hi> A Believer, as in himſelf, and a Believer as in Chriſt, are in a manner two different, diſtinct, contrary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. A Believer, as in Chriſt, is a new Creature; as in himſelf, and the remainders of Corruption in him, is an old Man ſtill, or rather, hath much of the old Man in him. A Chriſtian hath two different oppoſite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in him, as the Apoſtle elegantly and deeply diſcourſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19,—<hi>end.</hi> This Genius of Faith is much to be heeded in its bold Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the throne of grace.</p>
               <p>This boldneſs of Faith in this Court of Grace, acts in four.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In a <hi>free acceſs at all times, and in all Caſes.</hi> It is a Priviledge allowed by the Lord to his People, and embraced and improved by their Faith. There is no forbidden time, in which we may not come. No ſuch command as in that King's Court, <hi>Eſther</hi> 3.11. Here it is proclaimed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. <hi>Truſt in him at all times.</hi> Phil. 4.6. <hi>Be careful for nothing, but in every thing, by prayer and ſupplication, with thankſgiving, let your requeſts be made known
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93776:51"/> unto God.</hi> There cannot be a more large and comprehenſive account of the Matter of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Addreſſes to the throne of grace, than this. The Apoſtle preſcribes <hi>Prayer</hi> as a cure of perplexing <hi>Care;</hi> he hints that every thing that is, or may be the matter of <hi>Care,</hi> may lawfully be made the matter of Holy <hi>Prayer.</hi> Turn your <hi>Care</hi> into <hi>Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Care</hi> will evaporate and vaniſh, and your <hi>Cure</hi> will be felt. Bleſſed be the Lord that hath made this good in the Experience of many, who have gone before him, with Hearts filled and oppreſſed with many Cares, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned light and free, and <hi>their countenance no more ſad,</hi> as <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The boldneſs of Faith acts in <hi>free ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the mind</hi> to God. This the <hi>Greek</hi> Word in the Text particularly points at. Let us come with Boldneſs, <hi>free ſpeaking of all our mind; pouring out the heart to him,</hi> Pſal. 62.8. <hi>I poured out my complaint to him, I ſhewed before him my trouble,</hi> Pſal. 142.2. The Tongue is not to be tied at this Throne, but all that is on the Heart is to be told to him. He knows it before we tell it, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we do, but it is his Will that we ſhould make all our Minds known to him. A Believer, the better Caſe his Faith is in, he is the more open and free in dealing with God.</p>
               <p>It is recorded of a Man, that we ſhould hardly have counted a Believer, had not the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> numbered him amongſt them, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.32. <hi>he utter'd all his words</hi> (or matters) <hi>before the Lord in Mizpah.</hi> Judg. 11.11. So <hi>Samuel</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.21. <hi>And Samuel heard all the wordt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93776:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the people, and he rehearſed them in the Ears of the Lord.</hi> It is a great favour that the Lord allows us ſo to do. This is not after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men. It would be counted a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Impertinence, to vent all our Thoughts, and Caſes, and Concerns to a Creature; but we may do ſo to the Lord. When <hi>David refrained his ſpeech,</hi> and <hi>kept ſilence,</hi> it went badly with him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This boldneſs of Faith acts, and ſhould act in <hi>Familiarity</hi> with God. Believers ſhould come to the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> not as <hi>Strangers and Foreigners, but as fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> Eph. 2.19. Our Lord in his directing us to pray, bids us begin with <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven.</hi> The Spirit of Adoption helps to cry <hi>Abba, Father, Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. When Faith ſpeaks rightly this Word, and fixeth on it, all other deſires will ſweetly follow. <hi>Abba,</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> uttered in Faith, are the might of Prayer. Strangers know not what Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the Lord expreſſeth to his People, nor how much Familiarity he allows them to uſe with him. It was a great Word of a great Saint many Years ago in this Land, when dying, in a bright ſhining of the Sun of Righteouſneſs on his Soul: <hi>Tell it to the People, preach it at my Funeral, that God dealeth familiarly with Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This boldneſs of Faith acts in <hi>Importunity at the Throne of Grace.</hi> This Importunity is nothing but the ſtiffneſs and tenaciouſneſs of Faith. Faith ſometimes (and then it is beſt) will neither be beat back by delays from God,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93776:52"/> nor by inward Challenges; but when it hath got hold of God, it will keep its hold. Our Lord ſpoke ſeveral Parables to direct and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage to this Importunity. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. that of the <hi>unjust Judge</hi> and <hi>oppreſſed Widow.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 11.5,8. We muſt underſtand Parables warily. No Importunity did ever, or can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, prevail with God to do that for us, or give that to us, that he hath no mind to do or give: All he doth and gives, is in Love. Yet he puts his people on Importunity in ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if he were unwilling to give, when indeed it is that they may be more fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave, and that he may give the more. Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> tryed the Woman of <hi>Canaan, Matth.</hi> 15.22,28.</p>
               <p>So much for the firſt thing, What is the boldneſs of Faith allowed and commanded in Approaches to the <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2, What Grounds are there for this Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? There is need of great and ſolid ones to bear up this Frame: And, bleſſed be God, we have ſuch.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Gracious Diſcovery made to us of God in Chriſt.</hi> This is, as it were, the Eſſence of the Throne of Grace. The <hi>Fathers Name de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Son,</hi> John 7.25,26. It is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible that there can be any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Boldneſs in approaching unto God, unleſs we know this Name, and take up this Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of God. Many Profeſſors buſie their Minds and Heads with general Notions and Names of God, as that he is <hi>Gracious, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, long-ſuffering, abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, forgiving Iniquity:</hi> All good Names of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93776:53"/> God; but is he not <hi>just, and a hater of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, holy, and of purer Eyes than that he can behold it?</hi> But the main Inquiry is little thought on, Where ſhall we find the benefit of all the comfortable Names of God, and eſcape the harm of his awful Names? It is all in this bleſſed Name, <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> Eph. 3.14. If you approach to God out of Chriſt, you run into a conſuming Fire. Here is the Ground of the Believer's Boldneſs, The God he ſeeks, and before whom he comes, is revealed to us as Chriſt's Father, and ours in him. <hi>John</hi> 20.17. <hi>Go to my Brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</hi> Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Words, and the Speaker of them, and happy is the Believer of them. Faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand ſtrong without the remembrance of them. They are <hi>my Brethren,</hi> for all their faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and forſaking of me: I count and call them ſuch, though I be entred in part into my Glory. Tell them whither I am going, and where they are henceforth to ſeek me, and how to call on and Worſhip the Father, as <hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Theirs,</hi> and <hi>Theirs</hi> becauſe <hi>Mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Ground of Boldneſs, is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> But this being the third thing in the Text, I leave it to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Interceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> in his People, is a great ground of Boldneſs. They have not only <hi>Christ</hi> making Interceſſion <hi>for them</hi> at the Right Hand of God, but they have the <hi>Spirit himſelf making Interceſſion in them, and for them,</hi> Rom. 8.26,27. A ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93776:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> Scripture, that I would remark five things from, relating to this purpoſe. 1. Who is the Aſſiſter of Believers in Prayer. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf,</hi> as alſo he is called as to his Witneſſing, ver. 16. and the Word points at the immediateneſs of his Aſſiſtance. 2. What <hi>this Aſſiſtance is applyed to; our Infirmities.</hi> Infirmities in our ſelves, and in our Prayers, as the Apoſtle declares, <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for, as we ought.</hi> The <hi>Communion of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> is only with Believers, for he dwells in them only; and his Communion with them is only with his own new Creation in them; and becauſe this, as in them, labours with Infirmities, his care is about them alſo, 3. The <hi>way of his helping,</hi> is in the <hi>Original</hi> hinted, <hi>he helpeth with us,</hi> or <hi>over-againſt us,</hi> as a powerful Aſſiſtant to the Weak, in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a heavy Burthen. As <hi>Col.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I labour, ſtriving according to his working which worketh in me mightily.</hi> It is in vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Spirit's Aſſiſtance in Work we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or againſt Infirmities we indulge and comply with. 4. What this Aſſiſtance is, <hi>making Interceſſion for us, ver.</hi> 26, 27, <hi>and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Will of God.</hi> How can a Believer but prevail, who hath the Blood of the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> ſpeaking in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt crying in his Heart on Earth? <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. The voice of the Spirit is the beſt thing in our Prayer; it is that, God hears and regards. 5. But laſtly, how doth this Aſſiſtance and Interceſſion work in us, <hi>with Groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> What! on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>with Groanings.</hi> We would think it ſhould
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93776:54"/> be, that he aſſiſts with piercing cries that might reach Heaven, with ſtrong Arguments that cannot but prevail, with mighty force and power, that cannot be reſiſted. Is all this great Preamble of <hi>the Spirit it ſelf helping our Infirmitie's, and making Interceſſion for us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God,</hi> Is all this come to a poor unutterable Groaning? How ſtrange ſeems this to be! yet how ſweet is it! Some Groanings are ſo ſmall, that they cannot be uttered, for the Believer hardly feels them: Some Groans are ſo great that they cannot be expreſſed; as <hi>Job</hi> 23.2. <hi>Even to day is my complaint bitter: my ſtroke is heavier than my groaning.</hi> Sometimes the Spirit of Grace and Supplications, is a <hi>Spirit of Liberty and Enlargement</hi> unto Chriſtians in Prayer; ſo as they can by his Help, pour out all their Hearts to God, and plead ſtrongly: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is a <hi>Spirit of Groaning,</hi> working only ſenſe of want and breathings after Supply. There is more of the Spirit in a ſenſible Groan, than in many formal Words of Prayer. The Spirit is called the <hi>Spirit of Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. and the <hi>Spirit of Grace and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Zech. 12.10. Joyn both thoſe Names together, He is the <hi>Spirit of Faith in Prayer,</hi> or <hi>the Spirit of Prayer in Faith,</hi> Rom. 8.15. The <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> belongs to the <hi>Throne of Grace;</hi> and his Aſſiſtance doth give Boldneſs to Believers. The more you feel of his Help, pray the more boldly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>covenant of Grace gives bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Believers in their coming to the Throne of Grace.</hi> The <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> as well as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93776:54" rendition="simple:additions"/> the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> belongs to the <hi>Throne of Grace.</hi> Dying <hi>David</hi> had that ſight of this Covenant, that gave Conſolation to him under ſad Reflections. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure; for this is all my Salvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> Let us conſider ſome properties of the Promiſes of this Covenant (for the Covenant <hi>of Grace</hi> is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>of Promiſe,</hi> Rom. 9.4. Eph. 2.12.) that do give juſt ground for the boldneſs of Faith in coming to the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Exceeding greatneſs of the Promiſes.</hi> They are <hi>exceeding great and precious Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are given to us,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. When a Believer looks within, he ſeeth great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſold Wants and Neceſſities; that he hath nothing, and wants every thing. Some have thought that they wanted more Grace than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Sinner did; yet never any wanted more than is in the Promiſes. There is ſurely more Grace in the Promiſes, than there is want in the Creature. Creatures Wants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exhauſt Gods Fulneſs of Grace, and all this fulneſs is in the Promiſes. There is more of Grace in the Promiſe than there can be of Sin and Miſery in the Man that pleads it. Take heed how you compare your Neceſſities with the fulneſs of the Promiſes: Nothing you can need, but a Supply is promiſed. Study your Hearts and God's Covenant, and you will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find it to be ſo. We may ask any thing, for God hath promiſed every thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:93776:55"/>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Freeneſs of the Promiſes</hi> gives Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the Throne of Grace. That they are Promiſes of a Covenant of Grace, proves they muſt be <hi>free.</hi> A <hi>free Promiſe</hi> is a Bond given meerly from the Heart and proper motion of the Promiſer, without any moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or motive from the Party to whom it is made, except it be that of his Miſery, that Grace works on. If the Promiſes were not purely free to us, there could be no Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in pleading of them. See how the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namite</hi> pleads with the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.28. <hi>Did I deſire a Son of my Lord? Did I not ſay, do not deceave me?</hi> As if ſhe had ſaid, It was not at my deſire, but of thine own motion thou didſt promiſe me a Son, and I did not fully believe it at firſt; but now the Son promiſed is dead. So may the Believer plead; Lord, I did not ask of thee a promiſe of Grace and Glory; I was ſinfully contented in, and with my natural loſt Eſtate, and thou didſt call me, and quicken me with thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; wilt thou not make out thy Promiſe? The freeneſs of the Promiſe is the firmeſt Foundation of Boldneſs in pleading its perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. No other Promiſes, but free ones, are in the Covenant of Grace, and no other plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them but as free, is allowed to them that come to the Throne of Grace. If thou be for Merit and Worth in thy ſelf, go. elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; there is no place for ſuch proud rich Folks at this Court.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Sureneſs of the Promiſes of the</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, is another ground of Boldneſs at the Throne of Grace. They are <hi>the ſure
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93776:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> Mercies of</hi> David, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Sure,</hi> becauſe <hi>of grace,</hi> Rom. 4.16. <hi>Therefore it</hi> (the Promiſe, or the Inheritance promiſed) <hi>is of Faith, that it might be by Grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed.</hi> A promiſe is made for Faith, (would ever God or Man promiſe, but to be believed?) Faith is given for, and acts on the Promiſe; (believing without a Promiſe, is dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.) A Promiſe made by the God of all Grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. to Sinners void of all Grace, to give all Grace to them, muſt be a Promiſe of Grace; the Believer of this Promiſe muſt and can have nothing in his Eye, but the Grace of the Promiſer: Now, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> it is this Grace of the Promiſe and Promiſer, that makes the Bleſſing promiſed, <hi>ſure to all the Seed.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the Promiſes of God are ſure, becauſe they are his. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17,18. Promiſes ſworn for putting an end to the ſtrife of Unbelief. <hi>Balaam</hi> was a bad Man, and therefore called a <hi>mad Prophet,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.16. Yet by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling Spirit of God upon him, ſpoke tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and highly, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. <hi>God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is not a man that he ſhould lie, neither the Son of man that he ſhould repent. Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? or hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> All God's Promiſes are ſure, becauſe they are his Promiſes that cannot lie: And they are yet further <hi>confirmed of God in Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.17. So that the Believer, in his pleading of God's Promiſes, may lay down this Concluſion; I want indeed great and many Bleſſings, but I want nothing, I ask nothing, but what he hath promiſed who cannot lie, and what is confirmed in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:93776:56"/> the <hi>Amen, the true and faithful Witneſs.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers fail greatly in their neglect to quicken and ſtrengthen their Faith, by taking up the Promiſes in their full extent, <hi>Fulneſs, Freeneſs,</hi> and <hi>Certainty.</hi> It is always found, that Faith is weak, when the Promiſes are mean in our Eyes: But if the Promiſe appear and ſhine in its Glory, as God's faithful Word, then Faith is aloft, and acts ſtrongly. Hence it is, that all ſtrong believing gives Glory to the Promiſer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. and weak Faith reflects on him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.9. <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? doth his promiſe fail for evermore!</hi> Alas! it was the good Man's Infirmity to ſay and think ſo, ver. 10. but from his arguing I obſerve, that where Faith is feeble, a Man thinks the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fails, (as a giddy Man thinks the Rock he ſtands on ſhakes and reels, when all the ſhaking is in his Head or Legs) and when he thinks the Promiſe fails, he thinks the Promiſer is chang'd from what he was when he made it. And it borders on Blaſphemy, to rob God by our Unbelief, of his glorious Attribute of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs.</hi> If you have a mind to believe, keep ſtill the Promiſe in your Eye; if you would believe ſtrongly, view the Promiſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly and ſteddily. The Promiſe is both the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi> of Faith; it both begets Faith, and feeds it. Your firſt believing is from the power of the Promiſe; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and growing life of Faith, is by ſucking and drawing Nouriſhment from the Breaſts of the Promiſe.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:93776:56"/>
               <p n="5">5. Another ground of the boldneſs of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in their Approaches to the throne of grace, is, <hi>Their Priviledges that they are poſſeſſed of.</hi> So the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19,20,21. <hi>to drawing near with full aſſurance of Faith,</hi> ver. 22. Some of thoſe I ſhall name, with this Caution, that though all Believers have them, yet all do not know they have them; and therefore all do not uſe them as they ought, and would, if they knew them to be theirs. But all ſhould therefore labour to know them, that they may uſe them to the glory of the Giver, and to the Comfort and Edification of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt of theſe Priviledges is <hi>Election.</hi> And juſtly its called the <hi>firſt,</hi> for nothing can be before it, for it ſelf is before time, and all that they afterwards receave, flows from it. Election is that eternal and adorable Act of Free-grace, wherein <hi>God the Father</hi> paſſed over his Love to a ſelect Company of Mankind, that were to come into the World, appointing them to Salvation, appointing a Saviour for them, and all means fit to accompliſh his deſign of Love on them, to the praiſe of his grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4,5,6. This Bleſſing is revealed in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. When God gives Faith, he makes known his electing Love: and when we act Faith, we may ſee it. Faith is <hi>the Faith of God's Elect,</hi> Tit. 1.1. This, when ſeen, is a great ground of boldneſs at the throne of grace, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7. <hi>Shall not God avenge his own Elect that cry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him day and night?</hi> This our Lord prays upon, in <hi>John</hi> 17.9,10. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93776:57"/> haſt given me, for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in them.</hi> As if our Lord had ſaid, I am ſure to be heard, for I pray for them that are partakers of thine everlaſting Love. They are <hi>thine</hi> by <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>giving to me;</hi> they are <hi>mine</hi> by <hi>receaving</hi> and <hi>redeeming of them.</hi> We are bid <hi>give diligence to make our Calling and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. They are ſure in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſure to God; but we ſhould make them ſure to our ſelves; and many Chriſtians ſmart ſadly by neglecting this Diligence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>gift of Chriſt for us</hi> is a great priviledge, that gives boldneſs at the throne of grace. So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> argues, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi> (you may ſee who this <hi>all</hi> are, ver. 28, 29, 30.) <hi>How ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> As if he ſaid, it is a ſmall thing to God, to give us all other things, when he hath given his Son. We receave now many Bleſſings, bleſſed be the giver; we have greater things in the Promiſe, than we yet receave, or can yet receave, but ſhall ſurely receave in his time; yet all we get, and ſhall to Eternity receave, is far leſs than the gift of <hi>Christ.</hi> It is like our Lord had reſpect to this in that Word to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> John 4.10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> If ſhe had known <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the Well of Salvation to Sinners, ſhe would have employed him, and ſhould have been accepted of him. But here many Chriſtians ſtick; they doubt not but <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:93776:57"/> was given for his Church and People, but they know not how to apply this to themſelves. If I knew, ſay many, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was given for me, I would then come boldly to the throne of grace, and ask any thing confidently. <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;</hi> None can know that Chriſt was given for them, till they come unto him,: And all that come to him, may know that he was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for them, and ſhould believe it. He was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Will of the Father and his own, for his Elect. This is a Secret hid with God. He comes to Men in the Goſpel, offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and all his Purchaſe and Fulneſs, to all that hear of it. He that hath his Heart drawn forth to like this Bargain, and accepts by Faith of the Saviour and his great Salvation, hath poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion thereof immediately, and by that may come to know, that it was deſigned for him in God's purpoſe of Love. So <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.14,15,16. He was one of the Holieſt and moſt Religious <hi>Jews</hi> in their Church, and yet was at the ſame time one of the moſt wicked young Men in all the Country, a very Hypocrite, a proud ſelf Juſticiary, and a bloody Perſecutor of Chriſt, and his Church. Yet of this wicked Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is here ſaid, That <hi>God had ſeparated him from his Mother's Womb,</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. <hi>He is a choſen Veſſel unto me;</hi> I will pour out of my grace on him, and will do much for him, and by him. When did all this break out? <hi>When he called me by his Grace, and revealed his Son in me.</hi> Then he can ſay, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> And again, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:93776:58"/> All ſay ſo; but had he any mind of thee, and haſt thou any ſhare in his coming to ſave Sinners? Yes, ſaith he, <hi>of whom I am chief.</hi> He came to ſave me, the chief of Sinners. Any Sinner may come after me, and expect Mercy at <hi>Chriſts</hi> hand, when <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſped ſo well, ver. 16. He hath made me a Pattern of his Mercy, for the encouragement of all Sinners, that have a mind for a good turn from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Priviledge of <hi>Actual Reconciliation,</hi> and of being brought into a State of Grace, is a ground of Boldneſs in coming to the <hi>throne of grace,</hi> Rom. 5.9,10. where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> having ſhewn God's Love in giving <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the death for us, ver. 8. he adds the Bleſſings that flow from this Gift; <hi>Juſtification by his blood,</hi> and therefore <hi>much more Salvation from Wrath through him, ver.</hi> 9. And <hi>Reconciliation to God by his death,</hi> and therefore <hi>much more Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his life, ver.</hi> 10. The Improvement he makes thereof, is in ver. 11. <hi>And not only ſo, but we alſo joy in God</hi> (the <hi>Original</hi> is, we <hi>glory and boaſt in God</hi>) <hi>through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now receaved the Attonement,</hi> A State of grace is a State of boldneſs; all that are in it ſhould, and all that know they are in it will, uſe boldneſs of Faith at this throne of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. to ver. 6.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Experiences</hi> of Believers are a great ground of boldneſs. <hi>Experience works Hope,</hi> Rom. 5.4. The Experience of others, as well as our own, are of great uſe herein. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we find <hi>David</hi> improving the Experience of others, for the ſtrengthning his own Faith;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93776:58"/> ſometimes he offers his own Experience for the comfort of others. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul.</hi> Becauſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was in diſtreſs of Conſcience, and got Peace and Pardon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1,6. <hi>For this ſhall every one that is godly, pray unto thee, in a time when thou mayeſt be found.</hi> Pſal. 119.74. They <hi>that fear thee, will be glad when they ſee me, becauſe I have hoped in thy word.</hi> There is no Chriſtian that hath not Experience. As he hath a Soul that needs much to be done for it, ſo the Lord doth much for all he ſaves. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord dealeth variouſly with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore there is much difference in their Experiences: Yet becauſe all Believers are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Body, and receave all from the ſame Head, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there is ſome Skill and Capacity in every <hi>Christian</hi> to underſtand, and to be profited by the Experience of any <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Hence it is, that communicating of Experiences is a Chriſtian Duty, and a good part of the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> But there is much Chriſtian Prudence requiſite in the diſcharge of it. Let no Man <hi>boaſt of a falſe gift,</hi> and pretend to that he hath no ſenſe of: Nor talk vainly and proudly of what God hath done for him. All true Experiences are Acts of Grace from God, felt on the Soul. And Grace is humbling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receave? Now if thou didſt receave it, why doſt thou glory, as if thou hadſt not receaved it?</hi> Three Queſtions, confounding the Pride of Men and Chriſtians.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:93776:59"/>
               <p>Of theſe Experiences that ſhould give bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in coming to the throne of grace, I ſhall name three.</p>
               <p n="1">1, The <hi>Experience of the firſt viſit of Grace,</hi> is a good ground of Confidence in asking any bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God. Can you remember, when you were dead in ſin, and had no thought of grace, nor of thy need and want of it, but waſt well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with thy loſt State; and that in this State, grace came from this throne, and did beſet thy Heart, and overcome it? May you not argue, If the Lord ſought me out, and found me in my departing from him, and ſtopp'd me, and turned my Heart towards himſelf, may not I come now confidently and ask mercy and grace? It is a matter of great uſe to Believers, to keep up a ſavoury remembrance of the gracious change, that preventing grace wrought upon them. <hi>Paul</hi> could never forget <hi>Chriſts</hi> firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to him; but ſpeaks of it before Kings, and Rulers, and People, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. and 26. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members time and place, and every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. I ſay not that <hi>Chriſts</hi> firſt viſit is ſo ſenſible to all, or (it may be) to any, as it was to <hi>Paul.</hi> But <hi>Chriſts</hi> work of grace, may be known by it ſelf, even when ſome circumſtances of time and place, and outward means, are not known.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Experience of the Spirit of Prayer</hi> and of <hi>Anſwers of Prayer,</hi> is a great ground of <hi>boldneſs of Faith.</hi> I joyn theſe two together, for the Lord uſually doth ſo. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.1,2. <hi>I love the Lord becauſe he hath heard my voice and my Supplications. Becauſe he hath inclined his Ear unto me, I will call upon him as long
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93776:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> as long as I live.</hi> Have ye not known, that ſometimes yon have been <hi>ſo troubled that you could not ſpeak,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.4? that your Hearts have been ſo bound up and ſtraitned, that you could ſay nothing, and do nothing before the Lord, but fit as dumb and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, all dark above, all dead within, and all doors ſhut upon you; you durſt not neglect Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and you could not perform it? And have you not quickly found the two-leaved Gates caſt open to you, your Hearts enlarged, and your Mouth wide open in asking? The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ſuch Experiences ſhould ſtrengthen the confidence of your Faith. Have you not known what the anſwer of Prayer is? <hi>That he hath prepared your heart, and hath cauſed his ear to hear?</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. Come the more boldly at all other times. They are Triflers in Prayer, that know nothing of God by the Name of <hi>Hearer of Prayer.</hi> Pſal. 65.2. <hi>They that ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy. Whoever hath gone forth weeping, bearing</hi> (and ſowing) <hi>his precious ſeed, hath doubtleſs come again rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, bringing his ſheaves with him,</hi> Pſal. 126.5,6. and ſhould therefore ſow in hope.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Experience of Communion, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God,</hi> is a great ground of Boldneſs in coming to the throne of grace for more. Such as have moſt of this Bleſſing, deſire moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly more of it, and may deſire it the more confidently, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1,2,3,4. Surely we have this Fellowſhip with the Father and with his Son, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and we would fain have you ſhare with us therein, that your joy may be full. This Communion with God is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93776:60"/> undoubted to him that taſteth it, and ſurpaſſing all the delights of Senſe or Reaſon; incredible and unintelligible to all that have it not. A <hi>Stranger intermeddles not with this joy,</hi> Prov. 14.10. It lies more deep, than that any Eye of Fleſh can ſee it: It is of that nature, that only taſting can declare its tranſcendent ſweetneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good.</hi> Saints feel much of it, they talk much of it, the Word is full of ſuitable and ſavoury Expreſſions of it: Yet all are Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and dark Parables to them that experience it not. You that know what it is, though you cannot expreſs it, yet you can reliſh and underſtand ſome ſound Words about it. You know what it is to be brought near to him, and to have the Clouds and Vails, that are either on your Hearts, or on his Face, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and the light of his Countenance lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up upon you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6,7. You have been ſometimes ſo in the Mount, as to think, O how good it is to be here! You have known what the warm and healing Beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs upon you are, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. You have taſted that in his Company, that hath made the puddle of the Worlds Wells of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, loathſome and unſavoury: yea, as hath made you groan in this Tabernacle, and long to be in at that compleat and uninterrupted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion above, whereof all you taſte on earth is but a ſmall earneſt and firſt-fruits. And may not, ſhould not, ſuch come boldly to the throne of grace?</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:93776:60"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appl.</hi> Is there an allowed boldneſs in coming to the throne of grace? Then let us uſe this boldneſs. Alas! many come doubtingly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragedly. Their Unbelief is ſo ſtrong, and their Faith ſo weak, that they not only come without this boldneſs, but think that they ought not to come with it, but with a frame contrary to it. They think that it is true Humility, to come with a Fear, that is inconſiſtent with this boldneſs. It is indeed required, that Men ſhould come before the Lord with awful Fear and Reverence, and that they ſhould judge themſelves unworthy and undeſerving, both of the Priviledge of coming, and of the leaſt of the Bleſſings they come for. Yet the boldneſs of Faith is not prejudiced thereby. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore anſwer ſome of the common Pleas of Unbelief as to this Priviledge and its improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. Is from conſcience of Sin and Guilt, grounded ſpecially on theſe two Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20. This Plea ſeems to be ſtrong, and to juſtifie or excuſe doubtings in Chriſtians, and doth uſually marr the due ſenſe of this Duty, of coming boldly to the Throne of Grace. To remove it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſider that Sin affects the Heart and Conſcience two ways. 1. It defiles the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 2. It diſturbs it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sin <hi>defiles</hi> the Conſcience. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure; but even their mind and conſcience is defiled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we muſt ſee when, and how, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is defiled by Sin. Conſcience is God's
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93776:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> Tribunal in every. Man. It is an active and awful power in Men, judging of themſelves, as to their State and Actions, as they think God judgeth of them. So that there are two main cauſes tried, and to be decided at this Court of Conſcience. 1. <hi>Am I at peace with God, and he with me?</hi> And this is only truly reſolved, when Conſcience pronounceth as God declares in his Word. And that Declaration is, that every Man by Nature, and as in the <hi>first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> is an Enemy to God, and God to him; and that every one that is in <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> by Faith, is a Child and Friend of God, and God is at Peace with him. The anſwer then is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, if according to Truth. Some may, but will not, conclude their State of Enmity, by their not believing on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Some may, but dare not, conclude that they are at Peace with God, though they cannot deny their Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> A ſecond Cauſe, is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout particular Actions, and the Queſtion then is, <hi>Is this, or that, or the other Action, pleaſing or diſpleaſing to God?</hi> And this is to be determined by the light of Conſcience, acting according to God's Holy Law. For God is the <hi>only Lord</hi> of Conſcience, and his Will the <hi>only Rale</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> of Conſcience. Conſcience therefore may be three ways defiled. 1. By the <hi>unpardoned Guilt of a natural State,</hi> as it is in all Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Nothing <hi>can purge the Conſcience but the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> Heb. 9.14. An Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever doth not apply to it, nor apply it to himſelf, and God applys it to none but by Faith. Therefore all ſuch Unbelievers have all the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome filth of their natural State lying on their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93776:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> Conſciences, defiling it. The <hi>anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, is by the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. All Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Conſciences can ſpeak nothing towards God, by any thing <hi>Christ</hi> hath done, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, for they know him not, and are not in him. They would give an Anſwer, or make their Plea from their good Works and honeſt Meanings; but all ſuch anſwers and pleas are rejected by God, in his judging of a Man's State. For all God's Judgment of Mens State, proceeds on theſe two, <hi>in Christ,</hi> or <hi>out of Chriſt:</hi> And as it is with them, with reſpect to one or other of theſe two, ſo do Men ſtand or fall before God's Judgment, whatever the Judgment of their Conſciences be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſcience is defiled by <hi>Sinful Actions. known to be ſuch.</hi> Now if theſe be loved and delighted in, they do juſtly marr Confidence; neither can any Man in this Caſe draw near to God, but with the Mouth, and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.9,13. This is a Frame not to be found in a Believer. He may be guilty of known Sin, but it is not delighted in. To this <hi>David</hi>'s Words refer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.</hi> It is not, <hi>If there be iniquity in my heart,</hi> for <hi>who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my Sin?</hi> Prov. 20.9. It is not, <hi>If I ſee iniquity in my heart:</hi> For where there is leaſt ſin, it is beſt ſeen. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23,24,25. and groaned under it, and yet bleſſeth God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for the hope of Victory. But it is only, <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart,</hi> if I look kindly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:93776:62"/> on it, <hi>God will not hear me;</hi> and indeed the Man in this Caſe cannot pray. It is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a perſon approving and loving Sin, can make a real approach to God, as it is for a Man to depart from, and approach to one, at the ſame time, and with the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Conſcience is defiled <hi>by doubtful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. <hi>And their conſcience being weak, is defiled.</hi> To this belongs alſo the Words in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.5. <hi>Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind,</hi> and ver. 22, 23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith, is Sin.</hi> In deliberate Actions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Worſhip to God, to act without a clear Warrant from the Word of God, defileth the Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sin diſturbs the Conſcience. And Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is diſturbed by Sin two ways. 1. When the <hi>evil and filth of Sin is ſeen, a man loaths himſelf therefore.</hi> No defilement on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience diſturbs it, till it be ſeen. Men, like Swine, wallow in the puddle, and ſee no filth therein, till God open the Eyes of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. 2. When the <hi>danger of ſin is ſeen, and the Wrath it deſerves, is perceaved,</hi> then perplexing Fears, and ſenſible Sorrow works in the Soul. Now what is the courſe ſuch a poor Creature ſhould take? The Sin is committed, the Guilt is contracted, the Conſcience is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, the Defilement is ſeen, Diſturbance and Trouble is felt in the Conſcience; What ſhould ſuch a ſick Soul do? Will any ſay to him? waſh thy ſelf where thou canſt, and caſt away the burthen of thy ſin the beſt way thou
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93776:62"/> canſt, and then come to the throne of Grace. This would be ſtrange Goſpel indeed. We know no other courſe a Man ſhould take in this Caſe, but coming to the Throne of Grace, to have the Conſcience ſprinkled with the Blood of Chriſt, the only <hi>Cordial</hi> for a <hi>diſturbed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and the only <hi>Purger</hi> of a <hi>defiled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> was quite out in his Prayer, he prayed backward, when he ſaid, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man, O Lord,</hi> Luke 5.8. Were ever worſe Words uttered at the Knees of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> He had ſaid better, if he had prayed, <hi>Lord come near to me, and abide with me, and let me ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with thee, for I am a ſinful Man: Where can a ſinful Man be better, than with the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Sinners?</hi> But <hi>Peter</hi>'s Prayer, is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prayer of every Man, that ſeeth his Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and is ignorant of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>Publican</hi> underſtood Prayer, and plyed it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. when he ſaid, <hi>God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me a Sinner.</hi> I feel my ſinfulneſs, I ſee thy Mercy, Lord, let them meet, and thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall be glorified, and I ſaved. Whoever therefore are diſtreſſed with the guilt of Sin in their Conſciences, or with the power of it in their Hearts and Lives, muſt ſeek all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief at this Throne of Grace. It is only the power of that Grace revealed and diſpenſed at this Throne of Grace, that is too hard for Sin and all its powers. And for any Man to think to ſubdue Sin, except by the power of this Grace, or to think that he ſhall have this powerful Grace, without coming for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93776:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> it to the Throne of Grace, is to dream to his own deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. I am in the dark about my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come boldly to this Throne. If I did know that God was at peace with me, and I reconciled to him and juſtified, then I might come boldly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Whoſe fault is it, that thy Intereſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not put out of queſtion? Were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians more in ſelf-examination, more cloſe in walking with God, and if they had more near Communion with God, and were more in acting of Faith, this ſhameful darkneſs and doubting, would quickly vaniſh. It is a thing to be heavily bewailed, that many Chriſtians have lived twenty or forty years, ſince Chriſt called them by his Grace, yet doubting is their life; they doubted when they began, they go on doubting, and many die doubting, when the blame is juſtly to be laid on themſelves. There is an aſſurance of Faith, that is a <hi>Duty</hi> as well as a <hi>Bleſſing, Heb.</hi> 10.22. And were it more minded as a <hi>Duty,</hi> it would be more often attained as a <hi>Mercy.</hi> That aſſurance of Faith I preſs you to have, ſtands in firm and ſtrong Believing The faithful Promiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpel, is the Foundation of it. And the Ground will bear all the weight we can lay on it. This Aſſurance is not only a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that comes down from Heaven, but it may by his bleſſing of Means, ſpring up out of the Soul; I mean, it may ſpring out of the lively vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Actings of Faith. The great Believers we read of in the Word, the confidence of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93776:63"/> their Faith, roſe up to that height and ſtrength that we admire, from a clear perſwaſion of the truth of the Promiſes, and of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Maker of them. So it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.20,21. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the Promiſe of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed he was able alſo to perform.</hi> And leſt any ſhould think, that becauſe the Man was ſingular, and the Caſe ſingular, therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Believers may only wonder at it, and not atttempt to imitate it, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> adds, ver. 23, 24. <hi>Now it was not written</hi> (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.6.) <hi>for his ſake alone, but for us alſo,</hi> &amp;c. As if the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſaid, You ſee what ground <hi>Abraham</hi> had for his Faith, how ſtrongly he built upon it, and how pleaſing that was to God; you have the ſame ground, build ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon it by Faith; and that Faith in you, will be as pleaſing to God. <hi>Abraham</hi> had God's Promiſe to build upon. In this Promiſe there was its outward part and external. And this was, an <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> of his Body by <hi>Sarah,</hi> and the <hi>Land of Canaan</hi> for an Inheritance. The ſpiritual and main thing in the Promiſe, was <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Saviour, and the Bleſſing of eternal Salvation in him. This was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8,9. <hi>And the Scripture foreſeeing</hi> (that is, the Author of the Scripture foreſeeing) <hi>that God would juſtifie the Heathen through Faith, preached the Goſpel before unto Abraham, ſaying, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed: So then they which be of Faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</hi> His Goſpel and Promiſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93776:64"/> was of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come, and of Salvation by him. Ours is the promiſe of Solvation in <hi>Chriſt</hi> come already, <hi>delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. that is, <hi>impriſoned for our Debt, and ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for our Diſcharge.</hi> Now conſider how <hi>Abraham</hi> improved this Promiſe. He had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in his Eye, he would conſider no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Promiſe, and the faithful and mighty Promiſer. So muſt we; when we give place to conſidering of our ſelves, our ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unworthineſs, when we conſider the greatneſs of the Bleſſings in the Promiſe, how far they are beyond our deſerving, how many things there be that do make it incredible to Reaſon that we ſhould ever receave, or that God ſhould ever give ſuch great things to us, Faith muſt be at a ſtand. It is as incredible to to an awakened Conſcience, that God ſhould juſtifie a Sinner, as it was to Reaſon, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſhould have a Son by <hi>Sarah.</hi> Our only way, is to conſider the Promiſe. God hath ſaid it, and he will perform it, and I will believe it. If all the Angels in Heaven, or Faithful Men on Earth had ſaid, that God will ſave me from Sin and Wrath by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that ſuch a vile Creature, as I am in my ſelf, ſhall be accepted <hi>in that Beloved,</hi> I durſt not believe it. But when God himſelf hath ſaid ſo, why ſhould I doubt it? God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Goſpel deſerves our higheſt Truſt and Confidence, and ſuch as view it in all its Grace, Truth and Power, will pay it that due.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:93776:64"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe thy want of clearneſs, as to thy Intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that it is thine own fault, <hi>May you not come boldly to the Throne of Grace for ſatisfaction therein?</hi> If you know not who is your Father, may you not come to him to know it? There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worſe Prayers made than this, That the Lord would make manifeſt his own Work in you. <hi>Lord, help my unbelief,</hi> was a Believer's Prayer; complaining of Doubtings and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and praying for Light and Clearneſs, hath often diſpelled the Clouds, and brought the Soul under a bright Sun-ſhine.</p>

Yet all ſhakes her not; but by Faith ſhe replies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, and makes an Argument from this very Reproach. And bleſſed was the iſſue.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. What ſhould a Man do that never came to the Throne of Grace before? I can underſtand how a Believer may, and ſhould come boldly. Its no wonder that a poor Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar go boldly to that Door, that he hath been often at, and was never ſent empty from. But can, or may, a poor Sinner come boldly, the firſt time he comes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is granted, that uſually firſt Approaches to the Throne of Grace, are fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and weak, and not with that confidence of Faith, that Believers do grow unto by experience and exerciſe of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet a Man may come boldly at the firſt time: There is good ground for it. Firſt conſider the Text, <hi>Let us come boldly, that we may obtain Mercy, and find Grace.</hi> Who can, or ſhould put in for theſe Bleſſings, more than he that never yet got any? Do Receavers come to receave daily more Grace and Mercy, and may not one utterly deſtitute and needy, beg ſomewhat of this Mercy and Grace? 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ground of this Boldneſs lies fair and equal to all that will uſe it in coming. To name only now the Promiſe of God. This is laid before all Men in the Goſpel: Have you a hand of Faith to lay hold on it; that makes it yours. God's Promiſe is as ſure and true, before we believe it, as after. Believing adds nothing to the ſureneſs of the Promiſe. Our Believing is like a drowning Man's catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and laying hold on a Rope thrown out to him; his laying hold on it makes not the Rope ſtronger, yet it makes the Rope his defence. The Promiſe is equally true before believing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93776:65"/> and after Believing: But it is no Man's known property, till it be believed. The Cords of Salvation are caſt out in the Goſpel to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; yet moſt periſh, becauſe they do not lay hold on them. No Man can ſink into Hell, that holds the promiſe of Salvation by the Arm of Faith. 3. Conſider how the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. <hi>But I ſaid, How ſhall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleaſant Land, a goodly heritage of the hoſts of nations?</hi> That is dreadful indeed, when God makes ſuch a queſtion. Who can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Lord's Queſtions, but himſelf? <hi>And I ſaid, thou ſhalt call me, my Father, and ſhall not turn away from me.</hi> A moſt bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a dreadful Queſtion. ver. 4. <hi>Wilt thou not from this time, cry unto me, my Father, thou art the guide of my youth?</hi> An Intereſt in God by Chriſt is offered and promiſed to all in the Goſpel; plead it by Faith, and it is yours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We find Inſtances in the Word (and the like the Lord can make again) of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in ſome at their firſt coming to the Throne of Grace. As the blind man, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.46,—<hi>end.</hi> He only heard of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s paſſing by: He ſtaid not for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s calling him, <hi>but began to cry out, Jeſus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</hi> When many charged him to hold his Peace, <hi>he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me. Chriſt was never in my way before, and he ſhall not paſs now without ſhewing mercy on me, if cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may prevail.</hi> And that his crying was in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93776:66"/> Faith, <hi>Chriſt</hi> witneſſeth, ver. 52. In all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, the <hi>Woman of Candan</hi> was never at the Throne of Grace before, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.22,28. at leaſt, never at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Feet before: yet ſhe managed her firſt Addreſs with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that ſhe not only got her deſire, but that high Commendation with it, <hi>O woman, great is thy Faith.</hi> So the <hi>Centurion. Matth.</hi> 8.5,10. But above all Inſtances, is that of the <hi>believing Thief</hi> on the Croſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.40,43. Never had the Throne of Grace ſo little to encourage an Addreſs to it, as when the King of Grace was dying on the Croſs. Never had a Sinner leſs encouragement to come to the Throne of Grace, than when the <hi>Saviour</hi> was nailed to one Tree, and the <hi>Sinner</hi> to another. Marvellous Faith! a dying Sinner, dying for his Sins, imploys a dying Saviour for Salvation, <hi>Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom.</hi> How little did <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nailed to, and dying on the Croſs, look like a King? How ſtrong was the Man's Faith to believe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> through death, was going to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? And that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s gracious thought of him, would ſave him? <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Verily I ſay unto thee, to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> As if our Lord had ſaid, this is thy firſt and thy laſt Addreſs to me, verily it ſhall be heard. Believers do not think how pleaſing to the Lord, large and high thoughts of the Sufficiency, Fulneſs, and Freedom of the Grace that is in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> be. Believers ſhould <hi>deviſe liberal things, and by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral things they ſhall ſtand,</hi> Iſa, 32.8. Let
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93776:66"/> a Believer ask and think on the Warrant of the Promiſe as much as he can, the Lord <hi>is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do exceeeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. according to the power that worketh in us, unto him be glory in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all Ages, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, Amen.</hi> Eph. 3.20,21.</p>

               <p>IT is God's great and wonderful Mercy, that ever there was a Throne of Grace erected and revealed, and that he makes ſuch a Proclamation as this in his Word, <hi>Let all Men come boldly to it.</hi> I have ſpoke unto two things in the Text. 1. Of the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> to which we are invited to come. 2. Of the <hi>Boldneſs</hi> allowed in coming to it.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:93776:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The third thing follows to be ſpoke to, <hi>the Ground of this Boldneſs,</hi> implyed in this <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> And we muſt look back to ver. 14.15. for the finding the force of this <hi>Therefore.</hi> The Words are, <hi>Seeing then that we have a great High Prieſt, that is paſſed into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Jeſus the Son of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion. For we have not an High Prieſt, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, but was in all points, tempted like as we are, yet without ſin. Let us therefore come boldly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctrine I am to handle from this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Apoſtle is this, That the <hi>main ground of all the boldneſs allowed, in coming to the Throne of Grace, is in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Intereſt, and Room and Place that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath in this Throne of Grace, is the ground of all allowed boldneſs in coming to it. When people are ſecure, nothing is more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed by them, than fearleſs ruſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's Preſence: Any carnal careleſs Sinner, can, when he will, bow the Knee, and make that he calls a Prayer to God. But when Conſcience is awakened, and Light darts in to make them know ſomewhat of God, and of themſelves, it is then found a matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Myſtery and difficulty, to perceave any thing that can juſtly and ſufficiently ſupport the confidence of a ſelf-condemned Sinner, in his Approaches to God for Mercy. Hence it is ſo often ſeen, that this is the common way of all the ungodly, and of ſuch as are ignorant of God in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> while they are ſecure and blind and hardened, they feel nothing and fear
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:93776:68"/> nothing: But when Death and Judgment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ſtare them near in the Face, and when they begin to think in earneſt that they muſt ſtand before God, and receave their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Doom, being ignorant of a Mediator, and quite eſtranged from any believing imploying of him, they ſink in diſcouragement and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. And alas! How many miſerable Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are there, that are never awakened out of the ſleep of ſecurity, until they are plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the very Pit of Deſpair?</p>
               <p>The Reſolution therefore of this Queſtion, How a Sinner may draw near to the Throne of Grace, with confidence, ſo as he may be welcomed by him that ſitteth on it, and may receive good things thence, is only in this, that this Boldneſs is all in and by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> My Work therefore at this time (and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the main Work of Miniſters at all times) is to declare and ſhew you, how our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the Ground and Foundation of true confidence in coming to God. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I would lead you to ſuch things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> as are commonly known, uſually talked of, but rarely duly pondered, and improv'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the <hi>Perſon of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> by whom we may have acceſs with boldneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. A wonderful Perſon. The Son of God made Man, a marvellous Man, by whom all Men may be accepted with God, when there is not a Man in the World that can be accepted of God in his own Name: Yet all that come in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Name are accepted. Our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is God's own Son, the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93776:68"/> Son of God, tabernacling in the Fleſh. <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh. The brightneſs of the Father's Glory, and the expreſs image of his Perſon,</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be testified in due time,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6,7. In due time it will be ſeen, what this Ranſom was paid for, and for whom; for every one of the Ranſomed ſhall get their Liberty and Inheritance in God's Time and Way. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple commonly profeſs the Faith of this Truth, That our Mediator is God and Man; but how little is it improved by Faith? We do not <hi>conſider him,</hi> how great a Perſon he is, and how fit for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1,2. Such as have any ſerious thoughts of God and of themſelves (and they are in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn State that have none) find a Neceſſity of a Mediator, when they conſider the ſtrictneſs of his Juſtice, the Power of his Wrath, the perfect Purity, and Holineſs of his Nature, compared with the ſinfulneſs and vileneſs of their own Nature, Hearts and Lives. But there is another deeper Thought of God, that will diſcover as great neceſſity of a Mediator, and that is, of his Greatneſs; <hi>with God is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Majeſty, with God is unſearchable Glory.</hi> How can there be a bold and acceptable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to him, of whom we eannot frame a right ſutable Thought? How is it avoidable, but that all our Worſhip muſt be to an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>known God,</hi> for <hi>no man hath ſeen God at any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time?</hi> John 1.18. Here comes in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is not only a <hi>Screen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93776:69"/> Juſtice and us, but is a <hi>Glaſs</hi> wherein we may behold the glory of God. This glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is only to be beheld in <hi>the Face,</hi> or <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. All other Views of God's glory are either confounding, or but vain unprofitable Notions. All the Speculations of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> that poliſhed the dim Light of Nature, and all the curious Studies of ſome, called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> about the Nature, Being, Properties and Attributes of God, are nothing but pretty pieces of Philoſophy; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of ſound Theology in thoſe Thoughts, unleſs they be all ſtinted, limited, directed to, and determined by, that diſcovery that God makes of himſelf to us, in, and by his Son <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> The Mediation then of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is not only an Argument which, and on which we may plead with God, but is the <hi>Mean,</hi> by which only we muſt approach to God, and the <hi>Light</hi> wherein we ſee, and know ſavingly the God we worſhip. He knew the Way beſt, who is <hi>the Way to the Father,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>No man cometh to the Father but by me:</hi> And did anſwer <hi>Philip</hi>'s weighty and very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Deſire, <hi>Show us the Father and it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,</hi> thus, <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and yet haſt thou not known me, Philip? He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father: And how ſayeſt thou, ſhew us the Father,</hi> John 14.6,7,8,9. They all Worſhip an Idol, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a perfect Maze and Labyrinth, that ſeek God out of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> No where elſe is he to be ſought or found, but as a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire. God of old put his Name at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> to it they muſt come with their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93776:69"/> Sacrifices, when afar off they muſt look to it; as <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. When they are bid, <hi>remember the Lord afar off,</hi> it's added, <hi>and let Jeruſalem come into your mind,</hi> Jer. 51.50. Now, <hi>Jeruſulem, Temple, Altar, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of Holies, Mercy-Seat, Prieſts, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> &amp;c. were all but Shadows of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Under the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come, the Name of God is in him, and all Worſhip and Approaches are to be made to God, dwelling in this <hi>true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man,</hi> Heb. 8.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us conſider our Lord's Office <hi>of High Prieſt.</hi> So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls him <hi>our great High Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>we have him,</hi> ver. 14. This is a great ground of boldneſs in dealing with God, that we have <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a High-Prieſt. He was of God's own chooſing and calling; he is not of our chooſing, but he is for our uſing. Should that Man be called a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who hath no uſe for this great High-Prieſt? <hi>High-Prieſts were taken from among men, and ordained for men in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God,</hi> Heb. 5.1. Conſider the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Office to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and its uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to his People. <hi>He glorified not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be made an High-Prieſt, but he that ſaid to him,</hi> ver. 5. Chriſt's Offices of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> carry viſible plain glory in them: But to be made an <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> eſpecially when he is to be both <hi>Prieſt, Altar</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> ſeem to have no glory, but abaſement. But if we look to the inſide of this Office, it excels in glory. What unconceavable glory is it to Chriſt, to be the Reconciler of all things, to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93776:70"/> take up ſo honourably the grand Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt angry Heaven and ſinful Earth, to purge our Sins by the Sacrifice of himſelf, and then ſit down at the Right Hand of the Majeſty on high? <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. To offer a Sacrifice, in the Virtue whereof, an innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, out of all Nations, Tongues and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, are redeemed, and juſtified, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, for which he ſhall be eternally praiſed in Heaven by all the happy Inhabitants of that bleſſed place! <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. As for the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this Office to his people, I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name two things. 1. In this Office he <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageth all our Buſineſs with God,</hi> ſuch as we could never have done our ſelves, and muſt be eternally undone, if it were not done for us. To ſatisfie Juſtice, fulfil the Law, and bring us in a ſure Title to the Inheritance of Heaven. 2. By <hi>Him we offer all our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Services,</hi> and have them preſented by him for acceptance. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. We muſt do all in his Name. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us conſider what <hi>our Lord did when he was on Earth,</hi> And thence we have great ground for Confidence in coming to the throne of grace. This the Apoſtle hath in his Eye, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. and ch. 5, 7. Two things I would take ſome notice of, on this point. 1. He had the ſame things for ſubſtance, as Errands to the throne of grace, that we have. 2. That he did ply the throne of grace as we ſhould. Only premitting this, that there is but a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in what he did, to what we ſhould do at the throne of grace; and that likeneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93776:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> with manifold differences, as we ſhall regard.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had the ſame things, and the chief of them, that are to us Errands to the throne of grace. I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſome of them, and anſwer an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Lord had <hi>Affliction</hi> for an Errand, and more of it than any of his people. He was afflicted, yea, <hi>ſmitten of God and afflicted,</hi> Iſa. 53.4. <hi>He was oppreſſed and afflicted.</hi> ver. 7. <hi>If any man be afflicted, let him pray,</hi> Jam. 5.13. When Chriſt was afflicted, he prays.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Lord was <hi>deſerted.</hi> Bleſſed be his Name for it. We ſhould rejoice that he had not a life without Clouds. The bittereſt and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Deſertion that ever a Believer was under, is nothing to what Chriſt met with, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> None are ſo much to be pityed as a Saint under Deſertion: When Affliction is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and preſſing, if all be clear above, tho there be Clouds round about, yet if the Lord ſmile from Heaven, a Chriſtian's Caſe is not much to be pityed. But if all be dark about, and the darkeſt of all Clouds on the amiable Face of God, this is the extremity our Lord was in. Yet he prayed, and in his Agony prayed yet more fervently. <hi>Deſerted Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> take comfort in a <hi>Deſerted Saviour.</hi> His Deſertion was <hi>Penal,</hi> yours but <hi>Medicinal;</hi> though it be better Phyſick, it is of the great Phyſician's Preſcription, and he can and will bleſs it, and make you bleſs him, both for the <hi>Phyſick</hi> and the <hi>Cure.</hi>

                  </gap> far other thing than it is to us. Temptation is bad to us, becauſe of the danger of it; therefore he bids us <hi>Watch and pray that we enter not into Temptation,</hi> Matth. 26.42. when he was in the depth of his Agony. But Temptation to Chriſt was a meer Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There were never but two ſinleſs Men in the World, the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Adam. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> came to both. When he came to the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> he found nothing of his own in him, but he quickly got ſomewhat put in him, and left it with him, and in him and all his Poſterity. When he came to the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> he found nothing in him, and could put no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him by Temptation, <hi>John</hi> 14.30. The holier a Saint be, and the more groſs the ſin be he is tempted to, and the more hatred he have of the Sin, the greater is his trouble in, and by the Temptation. What Affliction then muſt it have been to Chriſt, to be ſo tempted as he was? <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our Lord had the <hi>charge and burden of ſin on his Soul,</hi> not upon his Conſcience, <hi>The Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53.6. And was not that a mighty Load! Senſe of Sin is the greateſt diſcouragement to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. But never was there a Man out of Hell, or in it, that had ſuch a load of ſin on him as Chriſt had. <hi>His own ſelf. bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. Law
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93776:71"/> and Juſtice, charged Chriſt ſeverely, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted more of him, than ever they did of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Perſon. None <hi>but Chriſt was made ſin,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Men are Sinners by nature, and increaſe their ſinfulneſs by their Life, and an inexhauſtible Fountain of ſin is in their Heart. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.3. But none of them is, or can be made Sin. <hi>He</hi> only <hi>that knew no ſin, was made ſin.</hi> And becauſe he was made ſin for us, he was alſo <hi>made a Curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. The Law curſeth the Sinner, but cannot make a Sinner a Curſe for others: It can, and doth make him accurſed, and a Curſe for himſelf. Here is Heaven's Art: All the Righteouſneſs we are made, flows from <hi>Chriſt's being made ſin for us.</hi> All the Bleſſing we get, ſprings out of <hi>Chriſt's being made a Curſe for us.</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, learn where to ſeek and find true Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and the true Bleſſing. In vain are they ſought any where, but in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in his being thus made <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>a Curſe for us.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> charged Chriſt with the Debt of his People's Sins; and he could not deny the Debt, though he contracted none of it, yet he undertook as Surety to anſwer for it, and to diſcharge and pay it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law and Juſtice exacted it of him, abated him nothing: Becauſe the Law will have Blood and Life for Sin, <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers and gives his. Our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> had no Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges in, nor Burden upon his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> yet he had a heavy Burden upon his Soul: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had a <hi>troubled Soul,</hi> John 12.27. though a <hi>quiet Conſcience.</hi> For trouble of Conſcience properly flows from the ſight and Senſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93776:72"/> Sin, but <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s trouble of Soul was from the Senſe of Wrath for the charged and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Sins of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But may a poor Believer ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew not what a Body of ſin and death was, he knew not what a bad Heart is, and theſe I feel, and am diſcouraged by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Chriſt</hi> did not know theſe things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by feeling and experience, as you do, but he knew them better than you do, or can. 1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew them by <hi>the Wrath due to them.</hi> He that paid the Debt, knew beſt the Debt that was contracted, though he himſelf did not contract it. He knew how dear the Expiation was for the Sin of your Heart and Nature. 2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew it by <hi>Temptation.</hi> Temptation brought Sin as near to Chriſt, as it was poſſible it could be brought to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Man. Some Saints know ſome Sins only this way. There are ſeveral Acts of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the Lord reſtrains his People from, before their Converſion ſometimes, and uſually after it. Thoſe Sins they know not by the committing of them, nor it may be by any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Inclination to them, yet they may know them to be dreadful Evils, by an external Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, and by the ſight of their Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery that wallow in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands to the Throne of Grace, ſo he did ply that Throne. Our Saviour was a praying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. He ſpent whole Nights in Prayer to God his Father. <hi>As he was, ſo ſhould we be in the World,</hi> 1 John 4.17. Are we afflicted, and ſhould we pray? So afflicted <hi>Jeſus</hi> prays. Is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93776:72"/> our Soul troubled, and do we pray? So <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, <hi>John</hi> 12.27. Are we deſerted, and pray? So did our Lord. But here is a depth too deep for us to wade in; how our elder Brother, how God's own Son in Man's Nature did plead at the Throne of Grace. This Throne he ply'd was not the ſame we come to. To us he ſits on the Throne himſelf, and therefore it is a Throne of Grace to us. We approach to God in Chriſt, and in Chriſt's Name. Chriſt came in his own Name, and needed no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. We find he came to his Father frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, earneſtly, and confidently. The Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> owe him eternal Praifes for that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>John</hi> 17. which is only properly Chriſt's Prayer: That in <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9, is a pattern of our Prayer taught us by Chriſt, but this is the Prayer made by Chriſt; and therefore truly the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer.</hi> Of Chriſt's praying the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Who in the days of his Fleſh, when he had offered up Prayers and Supplications with ſtrong crying and tears, unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in that he feared.</hi> This is a great Word. When a poor Believer is hanging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Hell, and a Spirit of Prayer working in him, how mightily doth he cry to be ſaved from that Death? <hi>O let me not fall in: if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou hadſt Mercy on a ſinking Soul, ſave me.</hi> But never did a diſtreſſed Believer cry ſo mightily to be ſaved from Hell, as Chriſt did to be ſaved from death. But that death, Chriſt prayed againſt, was another ſort of death than we know, or can fully apprehend. Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great ſervency, and with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93776:73"/> We rarely have them join'd in our Prayers. If we have confidence of a good iſſue, we are apt to grow cold in asking. Chriſt knew the bleſſed iſſue of all his diſtreſs, and believed it confidently, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.7,8,9. Yet prayed earneſtly. He was heard, and knew it. <hi>John</hi> 11.41,42. <hi>Father, I thank thee that thou haſt heard me. And I know that thou heareſt me always.</hi> Chriſtians, take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and direction to pray, and how to pray, by Chriſt's Practice when he was on Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us conſider <hi>Christ's Death</hi> for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging us to confidence in coming to the throne of grace. This is the main ground of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in coming. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Having boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus.</hi> There is precious Blood muſt be ſhed, or we cannot enter; we muſt ſee it by Faith, or we dare not venture; <hi>We muſt come to the Blood of ſprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12.24. We dare not ſtep one ſtep into God's awful Preſence, unleſs we ſee the way marked, conſecrated and ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the <hi>Mediator's Blood.</hi> How ſhall the Unholieſt of <hi>Sinners,</hi> venture to come into the Holieſt of all, <hi>God's Preſence?</hi> Yes, faith the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſuch may, <hi>by the Blood of Jeſus.</hi> Let us therefore conſider, what this <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> doth, and ſpeaks, in order to our boldneſs in approaching to the throne of grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Blood <hi>ſatisfies Juſtice, and anſwers all the Claims and Charges of the Law againſt us.</hi> What marrs boldneſs, like fears of a ſtanding Controverſie betwixt Heaven and us!
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93776:73"/> God is Holy, we are vile Sinners, God's Law is ſtrict, we have ſinfully broke it, and deſerve Hell moſt juſtly. No anſwer can be given, but by this Blood. What would the Law have, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave? Would the Law have a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Man to anſwer it? as it was firſt given to ſinleſs <hi>Adam. Lo, I come,</hi> ſaith our Lord <hi>Jeſus, without all Sin;</hi> a Man againſt whom, for himſelf, the Law hath no Charge or Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. Would the Law have perfect ſinleſs O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience? Chriſt did perform it. Muſt the Law have Life and Blood for every breach of it? Chriſt never broke the Law, but the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Millions of Breakers and Breaches of it, lay on him, and his Blood was ſhed for them: And thereby he fulfilled the Law, <hi>put away-ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf,</hi> Heb. 9.26. <hi>finiſhed the tranſgreſſion, made an end of ſin, made reconciliation for iniquity, brought in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs, ſealed up the viſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and anointed the moſt Holy.</hi> Dan. 9.24. You can never have boldneſs at the throne on grace, unleſs by Faith you apply this Blood. <hi>Chriſt is ſet forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. The Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is in his Blood, Faith in it makes it our Propitiation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Blood, as it is ſatisfying Blood, ſo it is <hi>purchaſing Blood.</hi> It is both an Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Satisfaction, and it is a <hi>Price.</hi> It is <hi>Redeeming</hi> Blood for <hi>Perſons,</hi> and <hi>Purchaſing</hi> Blood for <hi>Bleſſings.</hi> All the Bleſſings we come to the throne of grace for, are all bought by this Blood. So that we may ſay, that though we have nothing; and deſerve nothing, yet when
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93776:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> we ask all things, we ask nothing but what is well and truly paid for by our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. All the Bleſſings purchaſed and bought by Chriſt's Blood, are <hi>bequeathed to us, and left by him that ſhed it. Chriſt's Blood is a Teſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary bequeathing Blood:</hi> And Believers in their coming to the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> may come as Suers for the Execution and fulfilment of the laſt Will and Teſtament of our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi> For Chriſt by his death turned the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and new Covenant into a Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 9.15,16,17. His Death confirms his Teſtament. His laſt Will is, that all the Bleſſings his Blood purchaſed, might be ſecured and laid up for, and in due time given forth to them, they were purchaſed for, and bequeathed to. The whole Legacy of Grace and Glory, and all the Legatees are and were well known to the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Executor (though not to us particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly;) and the Teſtament will be punctually fulfilled. So much for the aſſiſtance to Faith, that Chriſt's death affords: Learn to feed on it. He that cannot make a Soul-meal, and take a Soul-fill of a ſlain Saviour, is a ſorry Chriſtian. A true Chriſtian, is a poor ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner, digging in <hi>Christ's Grave</hi> for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. There it only is, and there he ſurely finds it.</p>
               <p n="5">5, We find further in our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> (and indeed every thing in, and of him, helps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our confidence in coming to God) that this great Perſon, the Son of God in our Nature, this great Officer that lived ſo holily, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo virtuouſly, <hi>That he alſo roſe again from the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93776:74"/> dead.</hi> The Reſurrection of our Lord is alſo a mighty ground of boldneſs. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord and Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, which, according to his abundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> If Chriſt had lain ſtill in his Grave, our Hope had lain there too; but becauſe he roſe, our Hope alſo riſeth with him. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. where the Apoſtle hath an elegant Similitude. He compares Chriſt to the Ark of <hi>Noah.</hi> All that were in this Ark were ſaved, and they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Deluge drowned all the World beſides. They that were ſaved in the Ark, were ſaved from drowning in the Water, and <hi>were ſaved by water.</hi> The <hi>like Figure whereunto, Baptiſm now ſaveth us.</hi> Will bare Water-Baptiſm ſave? No: <hi>(not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God) by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſaid, He that by Faith hath ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Virtue of <hi>Chriſt's Reſurrection,</hi> and can by that Faith plead it before God, is a ſaved Man. If all the World periſh in the Deluge of God's Wrath, this Man is in the Ark, and nothing ſhall hurt him. But alas! <hi>Chriſt's Reſurrection</hi> is looked upon by many Profeſſors, as a part of Goſpel-Hiſtory and Truth, that it is a ſhame for any to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or doubt of, and therefore they profeſs the Faith of it: but they conſider not, that a great part of the Food of our Souls and of our Faith, doth lye in this point of Truth. This I would ſhew in three things.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:93776:75"/>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt's Reſurrection was a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Divine Dignity of his Perſon, Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the ſpirit of Holineſs by the Reſurrection from the dead.</hi> The glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rays of his God-head did appear in his Word and Works, and ſome had eyes to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth,</hi> even when he dwelt amongſt Men. <hi>John</hi> 1.14. But his Glory was under an Eclipſe till his Reſurrection. How ſtately and how ſweetly doth he himſelf expreſs it? <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.17,18. <hi>I am the firſt and the laſt</hi> (high Names of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eternal Perſon.) <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore. Amen.</hi> They that ſaw him dead, could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe he ſhould ever live again; and they that ſaw him alive, had need of Faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had ever been dead. He aſſerts both, and we ſhould believe both. Since death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the World by Sin, never was there a Man more truly, really, and fully dead, than the Man Chriſt was, who died for our Sins: And there is no Man on Earth more truly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, than the Man Chriſt is now a living Man in Heaven. He in his riſing gave proof of his Divine Power. <hi>He was crucified through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet he liveth by the power of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.4. There was never ſuch an appearance of Weakneſs in the Man <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as when he expired, and lay cold dead in his Grave. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſin reign ſo unto death, nor the Law's Power more appear, than in ſlaying the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> As great, and greater was the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93776:75"/> of his Divine Power in his riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>John</hi> 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life that I may take it again,</hi> Chriſt died that he might riſe again. He went amongſt the dead, that he might riſe from the dead. ver. 18. <hi>No man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of my Father.</hi> Chriſt was bid both die and riſe again: Bleſſed be the Commander, and bleſſed be the Obeyer; for our <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life is in this Commandment,</hi> John 12.50. Never any but Chriſt had this power of his own Life. We muſt yield our Life when God calls for it; and till then we muſt keep it, and when that Call comes, we muſt obey. We die, becauſe we can live no longer, and becauſe our times are in God's hand. And when it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to raiſe up our bodies at the Reſurrection, we receave our life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but have no power to take it up again, till the powerful Word of Chriſt come, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from your Graves:</hi> And that Word gives us our life again. None but Chriſt had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his own life, both to lay it down and to take it again. We dare, we can, we ſhould do neither; but only obey and ſubmit to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Will of our <hi>High Landlord,</hi> at whoſe <hi>Pleaſure</hi> we are <hi>Tennants</hi> in theſe <hi>clay cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt's Reſurrection,</hi> was a <hi>Demonſtration of the Acceptance of the Sacrifice of himſelf:</hi> That the Blood he ſhed, and Sacrifice he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, was ſavoury and acceptable with God,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93776:76"/> that the Debt was fully paid, and the Payment accepted, when the Surety was diſcharged of his Priſon. Therefore we find it ſo often writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that <hi>God raiſed him from the dead, Acts</hi> 2.24. and 32. even when it's ſaid, <hi>that it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he ſhould be holden of death.</hi> Death and the Grave are <hi>ſtrong and cruel,</hi> Song 8.6. They have taken, or will take, all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Priſoners, and are able to keep them: Only they took one Priſoner, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who was too hard, too ſtrong for them. <hi>Death had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over him,</hi> but for a little while, and by his own conſent. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. but it <hi>hath no more dominion over him:</hi> But he hath dominion over it. <hi>I have the Keys of hell and of death,</hi> Rev. 1.18. Courage, Believers in, and Heart-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed dreadful Jayls; but as long as Chriſt keeps the Keys (and that will be till he <hi>cast them both into the Lake of fire, Rev.</hi> 20.14.) no Believer ſhall ever be locked up in them. If Hell were ſearched never ſo narrowly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the condemned Priſoners there, no Man or Woman could be found in it, in whoſe Heart there was never one ſpark of true Faith in, or Love to the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. <hi>God brought again from the dead, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the blood of the everlaſting covenant.</hi> Chriſt alſo is often ſaid to riſe by his own power. Chriſt put forth his Divine Power in his Reſurrection, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared his full ſatisfaction with his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of the Work, and Payment of the Price of Redemption, by diſcharging of him in, and by his Reſurrection: The Angels Work
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93776:76"/> was only to roll away the Stone; but by his own divine Power, his <hi>bleſſed Soul</hi> did take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his <hi>dead Body,</hi> and he did riſe up immediately, a truly <hi>living Man.</hi> And this he did by his Father's Leave and Will, and the Angels ſerved only, as <hi>Sergeants</hi> and <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> to unlock the Priſon-doors of the Grave: For Chriſt could eaſily have removed that <hi>Stone</hi> by his own power, as he did greater things in his Reſurrection. No wonder the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> made it one of his great aims in Chriſtianity, <hi>to know the power of Chriſt's Reſurrection.</hi> Phil. 3.10. It is not to know the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his Reſurrection, nor is it to know the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of his Reſurrection, but it is to know the <hi>Power of it;</hi> the ſame Power that Chriſt rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf from the dead by, is put forth (and no leſs is needful) for the raiſing of a dead Sinner. The ſame Power that raiſed the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>dead for Sin,</hi> is needful for raiſing a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>dead in Sin.</hi> Rom. 4.5. <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we ſhould alſo walk in newneſs of life.</hi> Eph. 1.19. There is an <hi>exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead,</hi> &amp;c. How loath are Men to admit this, that the ſaving quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of a <hi>Sinner,</hi> requires the ſame divine Power that quickened the <hi>dead Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our?</hi> All ſaving Converſions are the Fruits of <hi>Christ's Reſurrection,</hi> and of Almighty Power.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:93776:77"/>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt's Reſurrection is the <hi>Pledge and Earneſt of our Reſurrection, and of eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How great things doth <hi>Paul</hi> build upon it? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. He proves our Reſurrection from Chriſt's Reſurrection. He argues for Chriſt's Reſurrection, by enumerating of Abſurdities that muſt follow on the contrary. As ver. 14. <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is alſo vain.</hi> ver. 15. <hi>We,</hi> the Apoſtles, <hi>are found falſe Witneſſes of God.</hi> ver. 17. <hi>Then you are yet in your ſins.</hi> ver. 18. <hi>Then they alſo which are fallen aſleep in Christ are periſhed.</hi> ver. 19. <hi>Then we are of all men moſt miſerable. But now Christ is riſen from the dead, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept.</hi> ver. 20. <hi>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead, The firſt Adam was made a living ſoul.</hi> ver. 45. but when he became a ſinner, he became a <hi>killing Head</hi> to all his Poſterity. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>The ſecond Adam is a quickening ſpirit,</hi> and gives eternal Life to all his Seed: And he took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this eternal Life in his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in our ſtead, at his Reſurrection. He conquers and ſubdues that death the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brought in, and reigns over it by his Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Christians,</hi> would you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire after the Reſurrection of the dead, as <hi>Paul</hi> did? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.11. direct all your Aims, build all your Hopes on Chriſt's Reſurrection. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> John 14.19. This <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Head</hi> will in a little time have no <hi>dead Members;</hi> with <hi>his dead body ſhall they ariſe,</hi> Iſa. 26.19.</p>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Chriſt's Aſcenſion to Heaven</hi> is a ground of Boldneſs in coming to the Throne of Grace. So in the Context. ver. 14. <hi>He is paſſed into the Heavens.</hi> This is great ground of Faith, that Chriſt is in Heaven, and <hi>for us hath entred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vail,</hi> Heb. 6.20. How dare a ſinful Man adventure into God's Preſence? Becauſe there is a ſinleſs Man there, that went thither on purpoſe to mind our buſineſs who are on Earth. No Man ever went thus into Heaven, and on this Errand, but our High-prieſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.13 All others go thither to <hi>get</hi> for themſelves, <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſcended, to <hi>get</hi> and to <hi>give, Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. How kindly did our Lord deal with his Diſciples about this, and how hardly were they peſwaded to ſubmit to his going away? He told them whither he was going, and for what; he told them of his returning again, and receaving them to himſelf, never to part more. <hi>John</hi> 14.2,3,4. And <hi>yet ſorrow filled their Hearts,</hi> John 16.6. He again ſaith, ver. 7. <hi>Nevertheleſs it is expedient for you that I go away.</hi> If you will not be content, becauſe it is neceſſary and fit for me, <hi>I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go away.</hi> How hard was it to believe this? What was, to all Reaſon, is more expedient, yea neceſſary, than that ſuch weak <hi>Schollars</hi> ſhould have their bleſſed <hi>Maſter's</hi> Company? it was ſo far from ſeeming expedient to them, that they thought they would be ruined thereby; and were very near it. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.21. Although the Matter be not ſo obvious to our Conceptions, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; yet really it is a greater Mercy and advantage to us, that we have our glorified
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93776:78"/> Mediator at the Father's Right Hand, than if we had him preſent with us upon the Earth. It is more expedient for us, that he is where he is, than it would be, to have him where we are. Poor diſtreſſed Believers, they cry for Miniſters and Chriſtians to pray with them, and for them: O but if they had one hour of Chriſt's bodily preſence with them, and had him to pray for them, as he did for ſome when he was on Earth, what heavenly Conſolation would it be to them? Take in by Faith the comfort of his being in Heaven, and his being as knowing and mindful of you, and as able to help, and that as ſpeedily, as he was on Earth, or could be, if he were now on Earth with you.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Our Lord's Interceſſion in Heaven, is a great and ſtrong ground of Confidence in coming to the Throne of Grace. This is in the Context. This is the laſt ground of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Triumph of Faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? it is God that juſtifieth. Who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh Interceſſion for us.</hi> His Faith begins at Chriſt's death, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of his Grave with him, aſcends up with him to the Right Hand of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it ſelf in his Interceſſion there. Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like this <hi>Riſing</hi> and <hi>Climbing of Faith,</hi> is his account of the <hi>Riſing of Grace</hi> on the Veſſels of Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4,5. They <hi>are dead in ſins</hi> when Grace finds them firſt: The firſt thing Grace doth to them, is to <hi>quicken them with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93776:78"/> Chriſt,</hi> then <hi>raiſing them up together,</hi> then <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi> All our Life ſprings out of Chriſt's Grave, <hi>John</hi> 12.24. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</hi> This heavenly Grain, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt be ſown in the Earth and die; and from the virtue of that death, all the Life of Grace and Glory grows up in all his Branches. He is indeed the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> that <hi>now groweth in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God,</hi> Rev. 2.7. And he is the Glory of the Place, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Food of all the happy Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But he was once dead in his Grave, and grew out of that Grave, up to all that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Dignity that we ſhall one day be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the beholding of, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. In this his Glory in Heaven, he interceeds for us. Interceſſion is a ſort of Praying. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Supplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks,</hi> are commanded to <hi>be made for all men.</hi> We have one fad Interceſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as made interceſſion to God againſt Iſrael.</hi> He was a ſevere Prophet, and had ſevere Service put in his Hand. But our great Prophet and High Prieſt, makes no Interceſſion againſt his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but all for them.</p>
               <p>This Interceſſion of Chriſt', which is ſo great a ground of boldneſs to us at the Throne of Grace, ſtands in theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his <hi>Appearing in Heaven in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in our Name, before God.</hi> Heb. 9.24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:93776:79"/> (and thoſe were the places the High Prieſts of old entred into) <hi>but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> He is there, not only for himſelf, to reap the glorious Fruit of his hard Work on Earth, but for his People, as their Head and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative. All the Church, the Body, is now in Heaven it ſelf, becauſe its Head is there. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5,6. Chriſtians, you are now lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pots, and defiled with the Smoak and Sutt of this ſinful World; you are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plunged in the Ditch, till your own Cloaths abhor you, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 9.31. You cry out, <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourn in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar,</hi> Pſal 120.5. Let Faith ſay, <q rend="inline">But where is my Lord and Head? Is he not in Heaven? in that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that I am not able now to bear a view of; and he is appearing there as my neareſt and deareſt Friend; I am aſhamed to look on my ſelf, and my loathſom Deformity; I am afraid that ſo foul and ſpotted a Face as mine, ſhould be ſeen in Heaven: But Chriſt is there, and my Chriſt is there, and there he is to <hi>appear for me,</hi> who muſt dread my perſonal Appearance there, if it were not for this Appearance of my Head for me.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt's Interceſſion ſtands in this, That <hi>he, in our Nature, and in our Name, preſents continually the Savor of his Sacrifice.</hi> Heb. 9.12. <hi>He went into the holy place, not with the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, having obtained eternal Redemption for us.

Our Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Anti-type, offered the Sacrifice of himſelf in his death, and in and with the virtue of that Sacrifice he entred Heaven, to ſprinkle the higheſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar therewith. It is but a fond <hi>Popiſh</hi> fancy, to think that there do remain viſible Marks and Signatures of his humbled State, on the glorified body of our Lord <hi>Jeſus;</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>to know Chriſt after the Fleſh</hi> in a bad ſenſe. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. But his <hi>entring with his own blood,</hi> is ſpiritually to be underſtood; that Chriſt's Appearance in Heaven, is to bring up a Memorial continually before God, of the virtue and ſavour of that Sacrifice he offered without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Eph. 5.2. <hi>Chriſt loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> This ſavour never ſpends, or wears out. The Blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the <hi>Virtue</hi> of it, in the <hi>Merit</hi> of it, and in the <hi>Power</hi> of it, is as freſh this day, as in the day it was ſhed on the <hi>Croſs:</hi> He is ſtill the <hi>

It is always ſavoury in Heaven, and it is always ſavoury to all them that are in the right way to Heaven. Our Lord in his Interceſſion fills Heaven with the Almighty and Eternal ſavour of his Blood, and Heaven is filled with the Praiſes of it, and of the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9,12. If its ſavour do not fill the parts of the Earth, where it is preached, it is becauſe Men have loſt, (or rather never had) the ſpiritual ſenſe that only can take in this ſavour, and not becauſe this Blood is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in its virtue. But this is the ſin and miſery of this condemned World, that what is moſt ſavoury in Heaven, is leaſt ſavoured on Earth; and what is moſt ſought after, prized and doted on in Earth, is vanity and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Heaven. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In Chriſt's Interceſſion, there is <hi>his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, and ſympathy with, the Ails, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes of his people.</hi> This the Apoſtle takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in ver. 15. His knowledge of their Diſtreſſes, we can more eaſily account for, than for his Sympathy. His Omniſcience as God, we believe. <hi>Peter</hi> ſweetly owned it. <hi>John</hi> 21.15,16,17. O that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would with power ask the ſame Queſtion at all of you, and that you could give the ſame Anſwer. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Queſtion is, <hi>loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:93776:81"/> Not long ſince thou ſaid'ſt ſo, what ſaiſt thou now? <hi>Peter</hi>'s Anſwer is, <hi>Yea, Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I love thee.</hi> And on the repeating of the Queſtion, <hi>Peter</hi> gives the ſame Anſwer, ver. 16. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> a third time ask'd the ſame Queſtion, <hi>Peter</hi> was grieved, ver. 17. and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> As if he ſaid, <q rend="inline">I dare not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my Love to thee, with that of others to thee; thou haſt reaſon to queſtion my love to thee, becauſe of my late woful denyal of thee; but yet I dare call thee to Witneſs, who knoweſt all things, that I do love thee. Though all my Brethren love thee better than I do, or can; though I be more unworthy than any, to be loved by thee; yet I am ſure I love thee.</q> If the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were as a <hi>hot Fire</hi> within, and <hi>its Coals were caſting out a vehement Flame,</hi> as <hi>Song</hi> 8.6. Believers would more often call <hi>Chriſt</hi> by that ſweet Name, ſweet to us to ſpeak, and ſweet to him to hear, <hi>O thou whom my Soul loveth,</hi> Song 1.7. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Souls are they who love not <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And dull unobſervant people are they, that know not what, or whom their Souls love. Is the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> a meer Notion? Is it not a moſt ſenſible, holy, and ſpiritual Paſſion, or rather a heavenly Grace! Can Men love <hi>Chriſt</hi> and not feel it? Should they feel it, and not avow it? Is there any thing we ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of in the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſmalneſs of it? That our higheſt and hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt love is ſo unſutable a Return to his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Lovelineſs, and his Wonderful Love to us, and the dear Demonſtrations of it. All ye
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93776:82" rendition="simple:additions"/> that love our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in ſincerity, look on him and love him more; love him with all your Souls, and bluſh with ſhame that you love him no better. Blow the coals of Love by Faith, and let the Flame mount up to Heaven, and <hi>aſcend ye in the Flame of the Altar,</hi> as <hi>Manoah</hi>'s Angel did. <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.20. You that doubt of your Love to Chriſt, go to him, fall down before him, anſwer <hi>Peter</hi>'s Queſtion, according to the true ſenſe of your Souls, and it will be, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> Love Chriſt, and ye will quickly feel ye love him. A ſight of Chriſt will beget Love, and Love will quickly ſpeak for it ſelf. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14,15.</p>
               <p>But for Chriſt's <hi>Sympathy with his people,</hi> this is harder to conceave, than his knowledge of their Diſtreſſes. It is a Sympathy different from what he had in the days of his own Infirmity; it is as <hi>tender,</hi> but not <hi>diſturbing,</hi> as <hi>real,</hi> but not <hi>afflicting.</hi> It is inconſiſtent with his glorifie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> State to have any trouble. His Sympathy it ſelf is to be believed, the manner how it acts, is unſearchable. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Prieſt in things pertaining to God.</hi> Heb. 4.15. He <hi>is touched with the feeling of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> and <hi>was in all points tempted, like as we are, yet without ſin.</hi> About this deep point of <hi>Chriſt's Sympathy</hi> we may ſoberly conceave, 1. Our <hi>Lord's Remembrance</hi> of his own Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, Temptations, and Afflictions, in the days of his Fleſh. This is plain and certain. 2. His ſure and diſtinct particular <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:93776:82"/> of his people, and of all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them, within and without. 3. His <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in them, and Care of them, and Concern for them, as his Members.</hi> 4. His <hi>Power and Wiſdom as their Head, to ſend down vital Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> upon them, as their Caſe requires. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>Laſtly. Chriſt's Interceſſion ſtands in <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting his People and their Deſires and Wants to the Father, for acceptance and anſwers of Peace.</hi> Both our Perſons, and our Prayers, muſt be preſented by <hi>this great High-prieſt, ſet over the Houſe of God,</hi> Heb. 10.21. or no Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, no Acceptance. An <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> though he brought, might not offer the Sacrifice on the Altar, only the <hi>Prieſt;</hi> and the <hi>High-prieſt</hi> only muſt offer the great Sacrifice for all <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> in the <hi>day of Attonement.</hi> Chriſtians muſt bring themſelves; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. and all their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sacrifices, but Chriſt muſt preſent them, and we only by him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. What a mighty encouragement is there in this for Faith? Our High-prieſt makes another thing of our Sacrifices than we can. Believers often know not rightly their own Caſe; Chriſt knows it exactly. Many of our Prayers are meer mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes; we complain, when we ſhould praiſe; we ask what would do us hurt, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to receave what would do us much good. Our Lord Jeſus puts all to rights; he can ſay over our Prayers rightly, he can make good ſenſe of them, can purge them of their Faults, can ſpy out any thing of his own Spirit in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93776:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> them; and, laſtly, add his own Incenſe to them. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. And thus are they accepted. We may beſt underſtand Chriſt's Heart and Work in Interceſſion, by <hi>John</hi> 17. Wherein we find three.</p>

The neglect of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, is ſin. Not to come to the Throne of Grace, when he calls, is a great ſin. To come to it (or rather to pretend to come) in any other Name but Chriſt's, is a great Sin too. And to come in this Name diffidently, is to reflect unworthily on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Power and Virtue of his mighty Name. <hi>John</hi> 14.13,14. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93776:84"/> my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye ſhall ask any thing in my Name, I will do it.</hi> Can a Man deſire a larger Promiſe than this? Can one deſire a ſtronger Plea than Chriſt's Name, and a better Hand than his, to have our Anſwers from? Be ye <hi>Askers,</hi> and <hi>Askers</hi> in my Name, I will be the <hi>Doer. The Father's Glory in the Son,</hi> and <hi>the Sons Glory,</hi> is concerned in giving good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all Prayers put up in <hi>Chriſt's Name.</hi> You cannot Honour and pleaſe Chriſt more, than in uſing his Name confidently. <hi>All Bills</hi> with <hi>Chriſt's Name</hi> at them, will be <hi>accepted</hi> at the Throne of Grace, and will ſurely be anſwered. But <hi>Coming to the Throne of Grace in Chriſt's Name,</hi> is another thing than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly people take it to be. Some think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that they conclude their Prayers with the Words Chriſt taught, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9. but never for that uſe, it is oft formally and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly put to: Some think that it is only to ſay in their Prayers, <hi>for Chriſt's ſake.</hi> To ask in his Name is a higher buſineſs, than to be reached by Unbelievers, and Men void of the Spirit of God. <hi>If no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.3. If Praying be required to be in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Jude 20. If <hi>praying always with all Prayer and Supplication,</hi> ſhould be <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 6.18. <hi>How ſhall Men call on him, in whom they have not believed?</hi> Rom. 10.14. But can you take the ſearcher of Hearts to Witneſs, that you build all your hopes of Acceptance at the Throne of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93776:84"/> Grace, in <hi>this Name and Mediation of Jeſus?</hi> That you durſt no more ruſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's awful Preſence, without the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of this great Name, than you durſt leap into a devouring Flame? Can ye ſay, <q rend="inline">I have no Name to come to God in, but <hi>Chriſt's;</hi> my own Name is abominable to my ſelf, and deſervedly hateful in Heaven; No other Name is given under Heaven but that of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> in which a Sinner may ſafely approach to God: Since the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is well pleaſed in this Name, and the Son commands me to uſe it, and the Holy Ghoſt hath broke this Name to me, and made it, <hi>as an Ointment poured forth,</hi> Song 1.3. And ſince its ſavour hath reached my Soul, I will try to lift it up as Incenſe to perfume the Altar and Throne above. Since all that ever came in this Name, were made welcome, I will come alſo: Having no Plea but Chriſt's Name, no covering but his-bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed and gifted Robe of Righteouſneſs: I need nothing, I will ask nothing, but what his Blood hath bought, (and all that I will ask) I will expect anſwers of Peace, and Acceptance only in that <hi>bleſſed Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi> beloved of the Father, both as his Son, and our Saviour, and beloved of all that ever ſaw but a little of his ſaving Face and Glory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let ſuch go and proſper; the Lord is with you, the Lord is before you: He will welcome the Mediator in his <hi>bringing you to him.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. and welcome you with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:93776:85"/> Salvation, who come in his Name for it. The Prodigals Welcome, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. is but a Shadow of what ye ſhall meet with Chriſt welcomes dearly all that come to him: And the Father welcomes the Believer that cometh in Chriſt's Name, and is brought in Chriſt's Hand to this Throne.</p>

               <p>FROM this Text, I have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>three</hi> of the things I did take up in it. 1. Unto the <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> it ſelf, that is erected for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to Sinners in the Goſpel. That new Court of Grace, which the Lord invites the fallen Seed of <hi>Adam</hi> to come unto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have ſpoke to that <hi>Boldneſs</hi> that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and commanded in coming to it. We are not only allowed to come, but we muſt come
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:93776:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> or periſh, and bring the guilt of our own Souls Blood upon our Heads, by refuſing. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.6. We not only may come and try, but we may, and muſt come boldly and confidently, expecting to ſpeed in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I have ſpoke to the <hi>great Ground of this Confidence,</hi> couched in the Word <hi>therefore</hi> in the Text, and relating to ver. 14, 15. Were it not for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Place and Buſineſs, and Heart in Heaven, no Man on Earth could have boldneſs at the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt thing in the Verſe, is <hi>the end we ſhould come for, and the great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we may receave by coming;</hi> expreſſed in two Words, That <hi>we may obtain mercy,</hi> and <hi>find Grace to help in time of need. God's Mercy and Grace</hi> are the moſt comprizing, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Bleſſings, and theſe Expreſſions of them, contain all that is needful for our Happineſs. Nothing can be added to them: No Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing but is in them; no Bleſſing is without them. It is the common Apoſtolick Prayer (and ſuch <hi>Prayers</hi> made by the Pen-men of the Holy Scripture, under the immediate guidance of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> are equivalent to <hi>Divine Promiſes,</hi> yea are ſuch) <hi>Grace be to you;</hi> ſometimes, <hi>Grace, Mercy, and Peace be to you.</hi> So that theſe Words, as they ſtand in the Text, do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually anſwer thoſe two <hi>Inquiries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What good things ſhall we get at the throne of grace?</hi> The Spirit of God anſwers: <hi>You may, and ſhall obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need?</hi> And are not theſe well worth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming for? Are they any where elſe to be had?
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93776:86"/> And here they may ſurely be found. How ſhould this endear the Throne of Grace to us, and engage to coming to it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wherefore ſhould we come, with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign? What end ſhould be in our Eye?</hi> Come, ſaith the Spirit, by the Apoſtle's Pen, that ye may <hi>obtain</hi> the one, and <hi>find</hi> the other. Come, that ye may get both. Deſign this <hi>getting</hi> in your <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would firſt ſpeak of <hi>our coming that we may obtain Mercy;</hi> and on it diſcourſe of theſe three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Of the <hi>Mercy</hi> that is to be got at the throne of grace.</item>
                  <item>2. Of the import of the Phraſe, <hi>Obtaining of Mercy.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Of the Duty required of <hi>coming with this Deſign, that we may obtain this Mercy.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Mercy</hi> that is to be obtained at the Throne of Grace. You ſee it is only <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> that is named, without any mention made, whoſe <hi>Mercy</hi> it is, or of what ſort it is. But when miſerable Sinners are invited to come to God's Throne of Grace for Mercy, it may be eaſily known whoſe it is, and what it is. It is God's Mercy in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat, or Throne of Grace; it is uot <hi>Angel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy,</hi> or <hi>Creature-mercy,</hi> but <hi>God's Mercy.</hi> And who can tell what a great and vaſt thing his Mercy is? Mercy in the proper Notion of it, is <hi>a kind, relieving Compaſſion to the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> The <hi>Object</hi> of Mercy, is a <hi>miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Divine Goodneſs</hi> ſhines in giving Being to Nothing, and in creating all things. Wiſdom, in ordering them, and guiding them to his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93776:87"/> Glory; Juſtice, in diſpoſing of them according to his Will, the eſſential Rule of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But <hi>Mercy</hi> hath no fit Object, till <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery</hi> appear for Mercy to act on. The <hi>Shower</hi> of Mercy is a compaſſionate Perſon; its <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and End</hi> is to relieve the miſerable. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with God, is another ſort of Mercy than what is required of, and can be practiſed by Creatures, We may, and ſhould have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the miſerable, whom we are not able, nor allowed to relieve. The Judge that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the Criminal, ſhould do it with Mercy and Compaſſion; but he breaks the Law, if he ſuffer his Mercy to delay, or divert a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sentence and Execution. But the Lord's Mercy, is not only Tenderneſs and Compaſſion in his own Heart (ſo we borrow Words, by the pattern of ſound Words in the Scripture, to ſpeak of God after the manner of Men) but it is always relieving to the Perſon on whom it is beſtowed: Let the miſery be never ſo great, and of what kind ſoever it be, whoever they be that are the Objects of his Mercy, they are certainly relieved thereby. There is no Redemption out of the Pit, though their Miſery that are there is the greateſt; Why? becauſe there is no Mercy for them. If it were poſſible that God's Mercy in Chriſt, could enter into Hell it ſelf (as it falls on many very near to it) that Mercy would bring them out: But the Door of Mercy is quite ſhut upon them; and the Lord hath reſolved and declared, that his Mercy ſhall never viſit them.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:93776:87"/>
               <p>That we may the better underſtand what <hi>this Mercy of God is,</hi> the getting whereof we ſhould make our great Errand to the Throne of Grace; it will be needful to conſider that <hi>miſery</hi> in men, that renders them needy of this <hi>mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I would conſider, as it <hi>actually lies on them,</hi> and is <hi>incumbent;</hi> or as it <hi>is coming on them,</hi> and <hi>imminent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>miſery that all natural Men lye under.</hi> It's true, they do not ſee it, nor feel it, but this makes not their miſery the leſs, but the greater. For inſenſibleneſs of miſery, eſpecially where it is removeable, and when this inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs is a hinderance of uſing the right means of removing it, is a great plague, and an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the miſery. I ſhall give you a few Scripture-accounts of this miſery.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The miſery of a natural Man, and of all natural Men, is that they are <hi>utterly deſtitute of all true good. In me, that is, in my fleſh, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. Muſt it not be ſo much more with them that are <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>in the Fleſh,</hi> and have nothing in them but <hi>Fleſh?</hi> The firſt notion we have of miſery is this, that it ſtands in a <hi>deprivation of good;</hi> and the greater that deprivation be, and the more good things a Man is deprived and deſtitute of, the more miſerable we count the perſon to be. He is a miſerable Man that is <hi>blind;</hi> becauſe the <hi>light</hi> of the World is ſo pleaſant and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the <hi>Eye</hi> ſimply needful to behold and uſe it. It is a great addition to this Man's miſery, if he be <hi>dumb</hi> alſo; becauſe the <hi>Tongue</hi> is a Man's Glory, and the Organ of expreſſing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93776:88"/> our Thoughts, and of Communion with our own kind. The miſery is yet further height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if a Man be alſo <hi>deaf;</hi> for the <hi>Ear</hi> is the Door of Knowledge, both of things Natural and Divine. If you go to the inward Senſes or Powers, if a Man be deprived of thoſe, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is yet greater. As it is a greater miſery to be void of Underſtanding and Memory, to be an Ideot, an Innocent (as we call them) than it is to be deprived of any of the bodily Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Now if one wanted all the Senſes of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Powers of the Soul (if ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be called a <hi>Man</hi>) would we not account this a moſt miſerable Creature? But if there be yet ſomewhat better than all theſe, ſurely then he that is altogether void of that, muſt be more miſerable ſtill. That there is ſomewhat better than all theſe good Gifts of Body and Mind, and that every Man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is without it, is moſt manifeſt in the Word. <hi>To be without God, without Christ, without Hope,</hi> Eph. 2.12. is more and worſe, than to be without any, or all outward good things. This deſtitute State is expreſſed by our Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Becauſe thou ſayeſt, I am rich, and encreaſed with goods, and have need of nothing; and knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and poor, and blind and naked.</hi> What a great difference is there betwixt <hi>Christ's,</hi> and their opinion of their State? And muſt not <hi>Christ's</hi> be right and true, and theirs falſe, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his? Were they any thing the leſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, were they not rather much more ſo, that they ſo miſ-judged? Our Lord ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates both their ſin and miſery, from their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:93776:88"/> ignorance, <hi>becauſe thou knoweſt not:</hi> Spiritual Bleſſings are of that nature, that all are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable indeed that are without them; but no Man is ſenſibly miſerable till he ſeeth that he is without them: It is the knowledge of this Want, that brings in the ſenſe of miſery. As every <hi>unpardoned Sinner</hi> is a <hi>miſerable man;</hi> but he never counts himſelf miſerable, till he feel the <hi>weight of Sin,</hi> and ſee the <hi>want of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Every natural Man is needy of God's Mercy, becauſe he is a <hi>condemned Man.</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Man is a dead Man in Law. As <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. ſo there is nothing but condemnation to all that are not in him. <hi>John</hi> 3.18,36. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> You may have ſeen and heard, how <hi>Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> will cry for Mercy from the <hi>Judge,</hi> when he cannot, and ought not to pity them ſo as to ſpare them. When they are bid hold up their hand at the Bar to receave their Doom, how earneſtly on their Knees, with Tears, they will cry, <hi>Mercy, my Lord, mercy for God's ſake.</hi> Every natural man is condemned. But how few of their Conſciences can witneſs for them, that they ever ſought God's Mercy ſo, as <hi>convict Criminals,</hi> an <hi>earthly Judge's</hi> Mercy. The Mercy they beg, is ſmall in regard of what Sinners ſtand in need of from God. An earthly Judge may reprieve or pardon to day, and the pardoned Man may die to morrow. But if the great Judge condemn you, and you are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, you are ſentenced to a never-dying mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93776:89"/> Priſoners beg Mercy of a Man, who, may be, is bound up by Law and Conſcience of his Oath, to ſhew none, but to execute Juſtice. Here the Caſe is juſt contrary; the Lord bids Men beg his Mercy, and condemns them only that deſpiſe it. We have his Command and Promiſe, and many acts of Pardon for our encouragement. What pleading for Pardon would there be at earthly Bars, if they had the <hi>Judge's Command</hi> to ask, his <hi>Promiſe</hi> to grant it, and his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> to that Promiſe? Such is our Caſe; yet few beg it in good earneſt. Be aſhamed and convinced of your ſin, when you ſee Men begging a frail, ſhort life of a Judge; and ſay, Alas! I never begg'd the mercy of eternal Life ſo earneſtly at the Throne of Grace, as theſe Wretches do a frail, ſhort, uncertain life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The natural Man hath all the Creation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and therefore is needy of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> The whole Creation groans under him, he is a burden to God's Earth, a plague to the Creations. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20,21,22. What a noiſe do Men make, and what pains do they take to heap up Duſt? If God proſper their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, they think he bleſſeth them, and count themſelves happy in their Enjoyment. But what is all this for, to a natural unrenewed Man? All theſe Creature-comforts will but be as ſo many Witneſſes againſt them in the day of the Lord. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.1,4. Men ſeek the Creatures, to ſatisfie their carnal deſires, and ſupply their outward Wants; but they do not remember, that unleſs the ſpecial ſaving Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God come along with them, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93776:89"/> are abuſed, and in their way, witneſs and groan to God againſt them. They groan to be put in God's room in Men's Hearts, and to be made Fewel for Mens Luſts: They all wait but for God's call to execute Vengeance on his Enemies. Is not ſuch a man needy of God's mercy, that hath the whole Creation of God at War with him?</p>
               <p n="4">4. But there is worſe than all theſe: <hi>The man himſelf, and all he is, hath, and doth, is under the Curſe of God.</hi> Gal. 3.10. What is the Curſe? It is the <hi>malediction of God on a man:</hi> It is God's devoting him to ruin. He is curſed in his <hi>Body,</hi> curſed in his <hi>Soul,</hi> curſed in his <hi>Family,</hi> curſed in his <hi>Trade and Eſtate,</hi> curſed in his <hi>Croſſes,</hi> curſed in his <hi>Mercies,</hi> curſed in his <hi>Life,</hi> and curſed in his <hi>Death,</hi> curſed in <hi>Time,</hi> and curſed to <hi>Eternity.</hi> Ah, how long and broad is this <hi>Curſe! Zech.</hi> 5.2,3,4. O what need is there of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! for it is this mercy only, that can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Curſe. There is no evil we are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of from an <hi>angry God,</hi> but muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved or prevented by the oppoſite Good from a <hi>reconciled God.</hi> If God's <hi>Anger</hi> be our Plague, nothing can remove it but his <hi>Love.</hi> If his <hi>Curſe</hi> be our Burden, only his <hi>Bleſſing</hi> can take it away. The whole Creation cannot make up the loſs of God's Favour. And this they know well, that ever ſaw the Face of an <hi>angry God.</hi> So much of <hi>the neceſſity of God's Mercy, from the preſent miſery of natural men.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:93776:90"/>
               <p n="2">2. I might proceed to ſpeak of that <hi>which is coming on them, without the intervening of this Mercy of God.</hi> We do not reckon a man miſerable only, on the account of what he feels, but alſo on that of his juſt Fears. And general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſmart of miſery is raiſed from fear, rather, and more, than from feeling. If any thing renders a man's preſent State miſerable, the apprehenſion of the duration or increaſe of what he feels, adds greatly to his miſery. Many, things would be little complained of as great Evils, were a man ſure, that in a moment they ſhall be removed: But in a Sinner's Caſe, for as bad as it is at preſent, it will ſurely be worſe with him ſhortly, if mercy prevent not. There is certainty of its coming, and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duration of it when it comes. It is called <hi>the Wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.10. <hi>Nothing like it</hi> ever came on them. <hi>Preſent Wrath,</hi> though dreadful, is but a trifle to that that is to come. It is <hi>Wrath to come,</hi> for it <hi>will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come.</hi> As ſurely as God lives, as ſurely as God is true in his word of Threatning, this Wrath will come on the World of the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. No putting of this evil Day far away, but in vain Thoughts; no diverting, or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it back a moment. All the united Force of the rebellious part of the Creation, will not be able to ſtem or ſtop this fearful Tide of Wrath. It is <hi>Wrath to come,</hi> for it is <hi>ſtill coming and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</hi> As many Days and Years as an ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinner counts in his life, as many Days and Years Journeys, hath God's Wrath made towards him. Think on this, <hi>Old Sinners,</hi> God's Wrath and you are near to meet, except mercy interpoſe.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93776:90"/> You think you run from it, but it runs after you, it <hi>will come upon you, and purſue you, and overtake you,</hi> as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.45. It's <hi>Wrath to come,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>always a coming, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſt.</hi> The Tide of God's Wrath on the Damned, is an <hi>eternal Flood;</hi> there will never be an <hi>ebbing.</hi> Look down to Hell, and ſee how they fare there. Alas! Men will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and fear, and fly, and therefore muſt feel. How many daily hear of this Wrath to come, and yet never have any fear of it, till they be irrecoverably plunged into it? Who never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken out of the ſleep of ſecurity, till awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Flaſhes of Hell fire? Who will never believe God's Wrath, till they feel it? No true Believer goes to Hell; all Unbelievers are ſent thither; but as ſoon they come there, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>woful Believers,</hi> becauſe <hi>eternal feelers of this Wrath to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mens danger of this dreadful State, ſhould make them cry mightily for God's Mercy, as it renders them unſpeakably needy of it. But your own ſerious Thoughts about it, would do you more good than many Words can.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing propoſed, is, What is the <hi>obtaining of mercy.</hi> A frequent manner of Speech in Scripture. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Who was before a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious: But I obtained mercy.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.10. <hi>Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</hi> This Phraſe of <hi>obtaining mercy</hi> ſpeaks forth,</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:93776:91"/>
               <p n="1">1. That the mercy is <hi>God's Gift.</hi> Our obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the fruit of his giving. <hi>I obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and may every Believer ſay: How ſo? he <hi>gave it, he ſhowed,</hi> he <hi>demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. It is the Lord's ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, tendering, and giving of it, that is the only ſpring of our obtaining it. We do not <hi>buy</hi> it, we do not <hi>work it out,</hi> we are no way <hi>meet</hi> for it, but by miſery. God's mercy ſprings not out of the Earth, but comes down from Heaven. It is the Gift of God: And as ſuch muſt all ſeek it that would obtain it, and as ſuch will all eternally own it, that do obtain it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Phraſe ſpeaks forth, a <hi>particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of mercy to the Receaver by the Giver of it. I obtained mercy,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, general mercy</hi> would not do my buſineſs, <hi>another man's mercy</hi> would not ſave me, I muſt have it <hi>of my own, for my ſelf;</hi> and ſo I got it. Mercy came to me, made me a Viſit, and applyed it ſelf to me in particular. So muſt it be with you. You will never be ſaved, you ſhall never ſee God's Face in Glory, unleſs his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy deal with you, and apply it ſelf as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to you, as if there were no other Perſon in the World, to be ſaved by Mercy, beſides thy ſelf. There is indeed a bleſſed multitude of the Veſſels of Mercy, and the <hi>Captain of our Salvation brings many Sons to Glory,</hi> Heb. 2.10. But yet there is a perſonal particular Application of ſaving mercy to every ſaved ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. And for this Application of mercy, we ſhould come to the Throne of Grace. Though there be infinite mercy at this Throne, and though many receave of this Mercy, yet you
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93776:91"/> muſt have of this Mercy for your ſelves, or you cannot be ſaved. Your <hi>Soul</hi> is your own, and no man's elſe; your <hi>danger, ſin</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> is your own, and no man's elſe; and the <hi>mercy</hi> that ſaves you, muſt be as much your own, and not another body's mercy. That deep Diſcourſe of of the Apoſtle, looks this way. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.30,31,32. <hi>For as ye in times paſt have not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, yet now have obtained mercy through their unbelief: Even ſo have theſe alſo now not believed, that through your mercy, they may alſo obtain mercy. For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> It is a great myſtery of Judgment and Mercy the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of, the <hi>rejecting of the Jews, and calling in of the Gentiles:</hi> Mercy took occaſion from the juſt caſting off of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to viſit the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and will in due time beſtow it ſelf again upon the <hi>Jews.</hi> But both of them muſt have mercy of their own; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the <hi>Jews</hi> will not ſave the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> mercy to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> will not ſave the <hi>Jews;</hi> both muſt have their own mercy. The <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> is the ſame, the <hi>Streams</hi> are the ſame; but the <hi>Veſſels</hi> are not the ſame, and every <hi>Veſſel of mercy,</hi> muſt have its own meaſure of <hi>its own particular mercy.</hi> So muſt it be with you, if you be ſaved by mercy; it muſt be your own and no man's elſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Obtaining of mercy ſpeaks forth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavers <hi>poſſeſſing of it.</hi> Obtained mercy is not only <hi>beſtowed</hi> and <hi>applyed mercy,</hi> but it is <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed mercy.</hi> Such things as cannot be poſſeſſed and kept, are worth little pains in ſeeking. But God's mercy is well worth the ſeeking,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93776:92"/> becauſe it may be both had by ſeeking, and kept when obtained, and is unſpeakably bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial when enjoyed. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17. <hi>The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him.</hi> As if the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaid, Man is but a Flower, his Life is a Wind and Vapour, that quickly and ſurely paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but it is not ſo with God's mercy; it eternally abides on all it falls upon. O that Men would think on this! As God lives, and is true in his Word, God's <hi>everlaſting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> or God's <hi>everlaſting wrath,</hi> will eternally lye upon every one of you, And what an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing difference is there betwixt theſe two? and yet how many behave, as if indifferent, which of theſe two ſhall be upon them? God's faving mercy is ſuch a Jewel, that though the Lord give it but to few, yet he will never take it away from any he hath given it to. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.28,33. <hi>Believers,</hi> God may take any thing from you, but his mercy; and you may ſpare any thing but his mercy. If God come to take away your Children, give them; if he come to take away your Eſtate, let him have it; If he come to take away your Health and Lives, yield them; ſtrive not with him, bleſs a giving, and bleſs a taking God. If he crave thy Right Eye, or Right Hand, and what is deareſt to you, give, yield all to him. But ſay, <hi>Let me only keep thy mercy, I cannot part with that, it is the only thing I cannot ſpare.</hi> The bleſſed <hi>Canaanite</hi>'s ſtriving with Chriſt, was about his mercy. <hi>Be ſilent, diſown, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me, I care not, but thy mercy I muſt have.</hi> It were a Cruelty (that only Unbelief
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93776:92"/> can charge God ſinfully with) to take away ſo precious a Gift, as ſaving mercy is. Let but this mercy <hi>follow me</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. and its no great matter where I go. If I be in the loweſt Hell, mercy will bring me out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.13. <hi>For great is thy mercy toward me; and thou haſt delivered my Soul from the loweſt Hell.</hi> There is no <hi>time-Hell</hi> that a Veſſel of mercy can be in, but mercy will bring him out again, and this Mercy will ſecure him from the <hi>eternal Hell.</hi> This mercy is God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, therefore <hi>ſoveraignly free,</hi> therefore <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> therefore <hi>eternal.</hi> You ſin, Believers, when you fear his taking away his mercy. He gave it at firſt, that you might be eternally poſſeſſed of it. Mercy gave mercy, and mercy will keep mercy, and mercy will ſtay with you, and keep you for ever.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be ſpoke to, is the <hi>end and deſign of coming to the Throne of Grace,</hi> and that is, <hi>that we may obtain mercy.</hi> Not only, that this mercy is to be got at the Throne of Grace, and there only; nor that this Throne of Grace is erected, on purpoſe to diſpenſe this mercy; nor is it only, that we ſhould come to the Throne of Grace, to <hi>ask</hi> and <hi>beg</hi> this <hi>mercy,</hi> but that we ſhould come to obtain it. This is the Duty exhorted to in the Text. And in ſetting about this Duty, two things are required.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Come as <hi>ſenſible of your need of mercy.</hi> No man can come truly without this ſenſe. He that hath no ſenſe of miſery, complements God in asking mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and takes this ſaving Name of God in vain. It is dreadful to provoke God to Wrath in our way
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:93776:93"/> of asking his mercy: And all ſuch contract this Guilt, and expoſe themſelves to his Wrath, that have no Heart-ſenſe of their need of this mercy. It is an amazing ſtupidity that the power of ſin hath brought on men, that in a world of ſinners ſinking into everlaſting miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo few are really ſenſible of their need of ſaving mercy; and no man is ſenſible, till God by Grace make him ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Come in <hi>Faith of his mercy,</hi> you cannot come at all without this Faith. Faith <hi>is coming to God.</hi> Heb. 11.6. Unbelief, is <hi>departing from the living God.</hi> Heb. 3.12. No man can come, but he that is ſenſible of miſery, for coming is the act of a man drawn and moved by the Cords of a man. No man can come but in Faith, for there is no other coming for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Theſe three things ſhould be in this Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A believing that there is <hi>abundance of mercy with the Lord, which if ſhewed and put forth to you and on you, would ſave you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</hi> So argues the <hi>Prodigal, Luke</hi> 15.17,18. <hi>And when he came to himſelf he ſaid, how many hired ſervants of my Father's have bread enough and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger? I will ariſe and go to my Father, and ſay,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 130.6. <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.</hi> The higheſt working of Unbelief is, when men judge their miſery greater than his mercy; The great work of Faith is to get theſe two to meet fairly; and mercy will ſurely prevail. His tender mercy is over all his Works, much more is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:93776:93"/> his abundant mercy above a ſinner's miſery. <hi>Cain</hi>'s words ſhould be left for himſelf, and uſed by none elſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. <hi>And Cain ſaid unto the Lord, my puniſhment is greater than I can bear.</hi> Or, <hi>My iniquity is greater than that it may be forgiven.</hi> Words ſounding like the Language of Hell, and not to be ſpoken by any that would eſcape it. I know many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure people find no difficulty in that they count believing of this, that there is mercy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with the Lord. But yet the matter is far otherwiſe. It is mighty difficult to believe the abundance of his mercy, when men are in great preſſures of miſery. The beſt of Saints have ſometimes ſtumbled here. When <hi>Moſes</hi> is pleading with the Lord for mercy to <hi>Iſrael, Numb.</hi> 14.17. <hi>And now I beſeech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou haſt ſpoken, and pardon, I beſeech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy mercy.</hi> As if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, Lord, thou haſt proclaimed thy Name, and I heard it, and believed it; but I did not think that their wickedneſs would have been ſo great, as now I find it to be. Was not <hi>Moſes</hi> a great Believer? yet he ſtumbled in this point of the power of God's Mercy. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.18,23. <hi>Iſrael</hi> murmureth for fleſh, God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a whole months diet of it. What ſaith <hi>Moſes, ver.</hi> 21, 22? How doth the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him? <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Is the Lord's hand waxed ſhort? thou ſhalt ſee now, whether my word ſhall come to paſs to thee, or not.</hi> This great man's Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was greatly aggravated, in that he ſaw the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:93776:94"/> Lord bring that people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with Signs and Wonders, and with a mighty Hand; he ſaw them daily fed, cloathed, and led, and protected with Miracles of divine power and mercy; yet one new difficulty ſhakes his Faith. When <hi>Paul</hi> gives us his laſt account of his Faith (for that <hi>Epiſtle</hi> was his laſt <hi>Writing</hi>) he lodgeth his Faith on divine Power. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day.</hi> If I be perſwaded that he is able, I ſhall not doubt of his being willing to keep that charge ſafe I have committed to him. Let the eye of Faith take up clearly the power of mercy, and the Faith of its application to thy benefit, will be the more eaſie. But he is a rare Believer, whoſe view of the power of mercy is not darkened, by a clear ſight and deep ſenſe of his own great miſery, at leaſt, at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
               <p n="2">2, To come for mercy in Faith, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Fitneſs and Sutableneſs of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to our miſery.</hi> Here many ſtumble wofully. Their Queſtion is, <hi>Am I fit for mercy?</hi> when it ſhould rather be, <hi>Is his mercy fit for me?</hi> And this Queſtion every ſenſible Soul can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; the other none in Heaven or Earth can anſwer. If any man think himſelf fit for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of all men, that man is moſt unfit for it, and fartheſt from receaving of it. But every ſenſible Soul will ſay, <hi>Though I be unfit for, and unworthy of mercy, yet mercy is very fit for me.</hi> Is there pardoning mercy with God? who is it ſo fit for as a guilty vile ſinner? Is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:93776:94"/> there ſaving mercy with him? Who is it ſo fit for, as for a loſt man, as I am. Come to the Throne of Grace for mercy, in Faith of this, mercy is fit for me exactly, though I be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unworthy of it. They that think they are fit for mercy, will never get it, nor indeed can ask it. But they that think they are needy of it, and that it is fit for them, will both ask it and get it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To come to the Throne of Grace in Faith for mercy, is to believe that there is <hi>all good will in him that ſits on this Throne to give and ſhew mercy.</hi> It is implyed in the Text, <hi>Let us come to obtain mercy.</hi> But what, if when we come, he will not ſhew mercy? That is an ungodly Suppoſition, miſchievous to our ſelves, and reflecting upon God. He hath mercy in abundance to give, he delights in giving, he never refuſed mercy to any that came for it, he hath promiſed he never will; and why ſhould men harbour ſuch a ſuſpicion, that we may come and not obtain? <hi>Benhadad</hi> could adventure on a report that the Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were merciful Kings; and yet <hi>Ahab</hi> was one of the worſt of them. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.31. And ſhall not ſinners come upon a more ſure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the mercifulneſs of the King on this Throne of Grace? It is on this Truth of the Lord's good will to ſhew mercy, that our Faith ſo readily halts: Many think they ought not to believe this good will to ſhew mercy; I would have you conſider ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Chriſt's dealing with Sinners. <hi>John</hi> 4.10. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93776:95"/> is that ſaith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> Where we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. 1. To whom theſe Words were ſpoke by our Lord; to a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> a vile Creature, as to the former courſe of her life, a blind, ignorant, ſottiſh Sinner, that was guilty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing <hi>Christ</hi> a Cup of Water, the greateſt Sin ſhe ever committed in her Life. 2. What our Lord ſaith to her: <hi>If thou kneweſt me, thou wouldeſt have asked; if thou hadſt asked, I would have given thee living Water,</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done, he made her know him, made her ask, and gave her of his living Water. But that I mainly obſerve from the Word of Chriſt, is a Truth, which few will believe when they hear it, even few Believers themſelves will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it as they ought: <hi>That Chriſt is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give begging Sinners eternal Life, than they can be to give Chriſt himſelf a Cup of cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Our Lord ſaith it, but men will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. Another of Chriſt's Words is in <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children, how much more will your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Chriſt makes the compariſon favourably, ver. 11, 12. Of a Child's asking <hi>Neceſſaries;</hi> will a Parent <hi>refuſe</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and give what is <hi>hurtful?</hi> But conſider our Lord's deſign in this ſaying: It is plainly to encourage to ſeeking; and the Argument he uſeth, is from the greater Love and readineſs in God to give the beſt things, than earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have to give their Children, the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of this life. The preference is not here
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:93776:95"/> given to God's <hi>greater Riches and fulneſs,</hi> than that of parents, who may have their Children beg of them, what they have not to give, as in <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.4. But it is a preference given to <hi>God's greater willingneſs to give.</hi> Now who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves this, and makes the juſt Application to their own Caſe? and ſay confidently, <hi>The Lord is much more willing to give me ſaving mercy if I ask it, than I am to give a bit of bread to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the life of the neareſt and deareſt Relation I have in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appl.</hi> I ſhall only add a few Words of Application.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is no principle of natural Religion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven more deeply on the Hearts of men, than that there is miſery in men, and mercy in God, and that God's mercy only can relieve men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this miſery.</hi> This runs through the whole World in all Ages, and will continue as long as ſenſe of miſery is in men, and any Notions of God are preſerved in the minds of men. And theſe Sentiments are not to be defaced. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> are damnable to themſelves, but vain Efforts againſt the <hi>Rock of Ages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Notwithſtanding of this, <hi>God's true mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Jeſus Chriſt, is the greateſt Riddle, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and Stumbling-block to all natural men.</hi> God's mercy they like well enough, and would have applied to their own relief under miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But God's only and true mercy in Chriſt, they cannot away with: That there is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with God for Sinners, but what flows through the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: That God's Love ſhould appear in ſending his own Son, under the charge of mens Sin, and under the ſmart
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:93776:96"/> and feeling of their miſeries: That as God ſhews mercy only this way, ſo men that would have it, muſt only ſeek it this way; the World never did, never can, never will underſtand, nor reliſh it, nor betake themſelves to it. They would have mercy to come to them another way, and ſo ſeek it and look for it in vain, and periſh by the miſs of it,</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is no Addreſs made to God, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to God, more acceptable to him, and more becoming a miſerable Sinner, than an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to God for his mercy.</hi> It is his <hi>Glory</hi> to be the Sovereign Lord of mercy; it is his Honour to be attended with the Addreſſes of miſerable men; it is his delight to diſpenſe mercy to the Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. What is more becoming God than to ſhew mercy? and what can be more fit, than that a miſerable Sinner ſhould beg his mercy?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There is no Provocation more common, than ſinful ways of begging God's mercy.</hi> I ſhall briefly inſtance in a few. Many profane care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Creatures, have this Word frequently in their mouths, <hi>God be merciful to me,</hi> who yet have no more ſenſe, either of God or of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of his mercy or of their miſery, than the Ground they go on. This is a groſs taking of God's Name in vain. Undue Addreſſes to God for mercy, are great Provocations. Some <hi>beg only outward mercies.</hi> Such people would like this Text well, if it had been, <hi>Let us come that we may obtain Gold and Silver, and Health, and long Life.</hi> If Prayer was ordained by God for ſuch mercies, the Throne of Grace would be crouded with Supplicants. But you will never ply Prayer rightly, till you underſtand
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93776:96"/> that there is ſomething to be got at the Throne of Grace, that is better in it ſelf, more needful for you, and that will do you more good, than all that the World hath to give. Some beg mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>only when they are under God's afflicting hand.</hi> Pſal. 73.34. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him.</hi> Some <hi>beg God's mercy limitedly;</hi> they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beg one mercy, and deſire no more: His mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is of a large extent, and we ſhould beg it all. We may beg a particular mercy according to our preſent felt neceſſities; yet we muſt not make an exception againſt any act of mercy. We muſt not beg the mercy of Pardon, with a Heart-quarrel againſt the mercy of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>The Lord be merciful to thy ſervant in this thing,</hi> 2 Kings 5.18. was a faulty Prayer, if there was any ſincerity in <hi>Naaman.</hi> Though we may ask any particular mercy, yet we muſt lay open our Hearts to the whole flood of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.132. <hi>Look thou upon me, and be merciful to me, as thou uſeſt to do unto thoſe that love thy Name.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.4,5. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Some <hi>beg mercy for themſelves and for their Idols in the ſame Addreſs.</hi> One part of their Prayer is for mercy <hi>to themſelves,</hi> and another part of it is for mercy <hi>to their Idols.</hi> Is not that a woful, ill-made Prayer? and yet how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is it done? <hi>Idols</hi> are ſuch things as have a greater, nearer room in the Heart than God hath. Whatever is more loved, feared, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and delighted in more than God, that is an Idol, be it the beſt or baſeſt thing we can name or think on. Theſe Idols are of two ſorts, <hi>Lawful,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful.</hi> Not that it is lawful to have any Idol; but many make I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93776:97"/> of lawful things: Such things I mean, that in their proper place, may be ſought, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed; but are wofully abuſed, when put in God's room. Theſe are the moſt dangerous, becauſe leaſt perceaved, Idols. <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> it is lawful to love thy Relations, to pray for Wife and Children, to beg God's Bleſſing on thy lawful diligence in thy Calling; but watch well, that none of theſe lawful things come in betwixt thy Heart and God; if they do, thou will fall into this Snare, of begging God's mercy to thy ſelf and Idols in the ſame Prayer. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Idols,</hi> or Idols in unlawful things, are <hi>Sins, Luſts, and Heart-plagues.</hi> Wo to him that begs God's mercy <hi>to them:</hi> We ſhould daily beg God's mercy <hi>againſt them.</hi> The more mercy, (that is <hi>forbearance</hi>) God ſheweth to ſuch Idols, the more Wrath, and the leſs mercy he ſhoweth to the man himſelf. God's mercy cannot be ſhown both to a man and his Idols. The pureſt mercy is then ſhewn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o a Man, when the Lord dealeth ſeverely with his Idols. <hi>Kill my ſinful Idols, and ſave me,</hi> is a fit Prayer at the Throne of Grace; and he is a happy man that gets it anſwered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Sinful Addreſſes for God's mercy, are great Provocations of his Wrath.</hi> His mercy is ſo Sacred a Name of God, that he will hold no man guiltleſs that taketh it in vain. In this matter, the beſt contract much Guilt: All have many ſins in their holy things, and in their Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Holieſt of all, the Throne of Grace, and do ſtand in need of Attonement. And we ſhould all come to the Throne of Grace for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to pardon the Sins that are in our ſeeking of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93776:97"/> mercy. But where then ſhall the Ungodly and Sinner appear? He periſheth for want of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he ſhould come for it, and he cannot come for mercy, while he is what he is, but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the Lord to more Wrath againſt him. This is one of the inextricable Straits that every Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer is in, that nothing but Sovereign Grace and mercy can bring one out of. Look to him for this deliverance, and he will ſhew you mercy.</p>

               <p>THE laſt thing in this verſe is, <hi>What is to be had at the Throne of Grace,</hi> and what we ſhould come for. And that is, <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and we need no more; and <hi>we ſhould come that we may obtain and find them,</hi> and we ſhould, in our coming, deſign no leſs.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:93776:98"/>
               <p>Of the firſt I began to ſpeak laſt day, and did open theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is <hi>this mercy we ſhould come for.</hi> It's God's ſaving mercy in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſutable unto, and for relieving of that miſery that every natural man is periſhing under. <hi>Mercy in God,</hi> and <hi>miſery in man</hi> are Relatives; and happy is that perſon that hath them well married and matched together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is in this Phraſe, <hi>Obtaining of mercy.</hi> I told you that it implied three things. 1. That mercy is <hi>God's free Gift.</hi> We only come by it, becauſe he gives it. 2. That there <hi>is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal particular Application of this mercy to the Obtainer of it.</hi> 3. That it is <hi>given as a Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> not as a Gift that may be recalled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; but is given for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion. Whoever is made Partaker of God's ſpecial ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy, it ſhall never be taken from him, it ſhall never waſte, nor ſpend, nor wear out, but ſhall ſtay with him, follow him, and grow up with him to eternity. The Burden of that heaven-like Song, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. is 26 times repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> How ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will it be ſung from all the Manſions in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and by all the bleſſed Dwellers in them? <hi>O Give thanks to our God, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever:</hi> Can you learn this Song? as the Word is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3. Only the <hi>Redeemed of the Lord</hi> can <hi>ſay ſo;</hi> but all <hi>they ſhould ſay ſo,</hi> Pſal. 107.1,2. His mercy is moſt ſweet, a Crumb of it will ſave a ſtarving Soul; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.27. A large meaſure of it on Earth, is a Heaven: But the eternity of this mercy, is the mercy of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93776:99"/> Time-mercies, in regard of this, are no mercies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ſpoke of the Deſign and End we ſhould have before us in coming to the Throne of Grace. <hi>Come that we may obtain mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which I would do at this Exerciſe, is to apply this Truth. And the Lord apply both Doctrine and Application.</p>
               <p>And 1. I would put this Queſtion to your Conſciences and let them ſpeak as in God's ſight. <hi>Whether have ye obtained mercy or not?</hi> Can you ſay with <hi>Paul, but I obtained mercy?</hi> You muſt have it as well as he, and may know it as really as he did; though ye receave not ſo much, nor know it ſo clearly, as ſo great a Believer as <hi>Paul,</hi> did. See to get your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences well reſolved in this main Caſe, that you may be able to give a peremptory anſwer. The Importance of this Queſtion is very obvious. Can a Man retire within, and look up to God, and conſider this, <hi>I am a miſerable Sinner in my ſelf, as all are, nothing but God's ſpecial mercy can relieve me:</hi> And not think it a matter of vaſt conſequence to know whether he hath obtained this mercy or no? Wo to them that never asked the Queſtion, and they are but in a ſorry caſe that cannot anſwer it.</p>
               <p>I would propoſe a few things to enforce the Duty of trying your ſelves in this matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is mercy you have been ſeeking.</hi> If ever you made any faſhion of Prayer, ſurely it was mercy you ſought; moſt of you, if not all, pray, at leaſt, ſometimes: Now, whenever you pray, unleſs you be wofully formal and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:93776:99"/> ſtupid, your Conſciences muſt tell you, it is mercy you ſeek. Have you long and often begged God's mercy? and will ye never enquire, whether or not you have got it? None ask in earneſt, but they will try how they ſpeed. There is no ſurer and plainer Argument of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling in Prayer, than when men are careleſs what they get by Prayer. We would be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Generation of them that ſeek God's Face; and ſhall we not enquire if we have found him? Our Lord bids us ask, that we may receave; and ſhall we ask, and not think of receaving? nor try if we have receaved?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A great many round you, have obtained mercy;</hi> therefore it becomes you to enquire whether you have obtained it. If the mercy of God were ſo very rarely diſpenſed, that none, if any, in an Age, did partake of it, this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect would be a little more excuſable: But, when mercy falls round about thee, when one on thy Right Hand obtains Mercy, and another on thy Left Hand obtains Mercy, when this Mercy falls on ſome of the Family thou lives in, on ſome of the Congregation thou hears in, when this mercy falls on one that hath the ſame natural Parents that thou haſt; Will none of theſe things make you ask, <hi>Have I alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy?</hi> We find our Lord aggravating the <hi>miſery of the damned,</hi> by their ſeeing of the <hi>bleſſedneſs of the ſaved, Luke</hi> 13.28. <hi>There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, when ye ſhall ſee Abraham and Iſaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you your ſelves thruſt out.</hi> A moſt dreadful Paſſage: <hi>Chriſt.</hi> is telling Men that were to be excluded from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:93776:100"/> what they would think, ſay, and do, in that diſmal Caſe. Prevent this Miſery in time, by enquiring whether you have obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And do ſo the rather, that ye may ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers partaking of this Mercy. When you ſee the ſaving mercy of God ſought and obtained by others, it ſhould provoke you greatly, not to envy them their ſhare, but to deſire a ſhare of your own; for there is enough and to ſpare. And the Lord doth ſhew mercy to ſome on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he may encourage others to come, and ask, and obtain. So <hi>Paul</hi> tells wherefore he got his Mercy. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Howbeit, for this cauſe I obtained mercy, that in me firſt</hi> (or the <hi>chief</hi>) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a pattern to them, which ſhould hereafter believe on him, to life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> There were other ends <hi>Chriſt</hi> had in ſhewing mercy to <hi>Paul:</hi> The Lord ſhewed him mercy, that he might be ſaved eternally; he ſhewed him mercy, that he might be <hi>an able Miniſter of the new Teſtament,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. and a ſucceſsful Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath good Cauſe now for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages, to bleſs our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> for that rich mercy, which that <hi>choſen Veſſel obtained</hi> and was filled with. But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in that place, takes notice of another deſign of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to him, and that was, to ſet up <hi>Paul</hi> as a Pattern, and Copy of the Freedom, Riches, and Power of ſaving mercy. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> can, when he will, write another Copy, like <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſomewhat like it, he doth in all that he calls ſavingly. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4. Take in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, many obtain mercy, and why not I?
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:93776:100"/> none deſerve it, yet many have it. None de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it leſs, and need it more than I: Why then not I? If you ſee the Lord ſhewing mercy to others, and you care not for mercy to your ſelves, how can you expect it, or think you have got it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Inquire whether you have receaved God's ſaving mercy, becauſe this <hi>mercy is brought ſo near you, that it muſt either be receaved or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed;</hi> there is no midſt: No Man doth neither, no man doth both. All that have the offer of God's ſaving mercy in the Goſpel, do and muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily either receave or reject it. This ſhould make people inquire the more narrowly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have obtained mercy. If ye have not obtained it, ye have refuſed it. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. <hi>It was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you; but ſeeing you put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</hi> This laſt is a ſtrange Phraſe. I am perſwaded in the Lord, that no man ſhall ever get everlaſting life, that thinks himſelf worthy of it. It is always to be ſought by us, always given by the Lord, and always taken by the Receavers of it, as an Alms of Grace for Chriſt's ſake. Nothing ſurely was further from <hi>Paul</hi>'s mind, than to have theſe fooliſh <hi>Jews</hi> to count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſerving of eternal life; or that on the account, either of their Priviledges or Works, they did or could deſerve Salvation at the hand of God. But all the Apoſtle meant was this; Everlaſting Life is brought near to you in this Word of the Goſpel, you put the Word from you, thereby you declare you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:93776:101"/> to receave everlaſting life, and God counts you unworthy of the Offer of it, and we will carry it to others, as he tells other Unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Rome. Acts</hi> 28.28. Be it <hi>known to you, that the Salvation of God is ſent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for reſolving of this Queſtion, whether you have obtained ſpecial ſaving mercy, or not. This ſeems eaſily determinable. There is ſo great a difference betwixt that State of ſin and miſery, that mercy finds Men in, when it firſt viſits them, and that State that mercy brings them to; That we are apt to think the change may be eaſily known. See <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1,18. Yet there are ſo many things that obſtruct, both them that have obtained mercy from owning it, and them that have not obtained it from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their want of it (of which I ſhall not now ſpeak) that ſearching is needful, and for your help in that work, I offer theſe few plain Marks.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>high value of ſpecial ſaving mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove common mercy,</hi> is a good ſign of one that hath obtained ſaving mercy. There is a <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mercy</hi> of God, and there is a <hi>common mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Special mercy</hi> is ſaving, it comes from the Heart and Love of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4. and is treaſured up for, and laid out only upon his choſen. It is the <hi>favour he bears to his people,</hi> Pſal. 106.4. <hi>Common mercies</hi> are thrown about with a large and indifferent hand; <hi>He maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth rain on the juſt, and on the unjuſt,</hi> Matth. 5.45. Now theſe two ſorts of mercies are as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:93776:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> far different, as Heaven and Earth. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the one is far beyond that of the other, though we be unworthy of either. <hi>I am leſs than the leaſt of all thy mercies,</hi> ſaid a <hi>great Saint,</hi> Gen. 32.10. And ſo ſhould all ſay. But few do perceave this great difference, and many give the preference to common out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercy. Who but a Chriſtian doth count it a greater mercy to have the Conſcience ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than to have a large and proſperous Eſtate in the World? That the light of God's Countenance, and an hour ſpent in his Courts, (when the King's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is in them) is better than all the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this World? <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Man that obtained ſingular mercy from the Lord; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in this, that he <hi>eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> Heb. 11.26. He had excellent Balances and true Weights. He put in the one Scale <hi>Egypt's Honours, Treaſures,</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> (and how weighty are ſuch things in the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Balances?) and in the other, <hi>the reproach of Christ, and affliction with the people of God.</hi> His Judgment on this weighing, is, That this Reproach, becauſe of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> concern in it, and this Affliction, becauſe it is of and with God's people, is better than all the other things. The true Teſt of Mens Spirit is juſtly taken from their ſetled, inward Apprehenſion of the worth and value of ſpiritual ſaving mercy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all outward mercy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6,7. <hi>There be many that ſay, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Moſt Men are for <hi>any good,</hi> they know not well what, and from any hand that can ſhow it
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93776:102" rendition="simple:additions"/> and give it. But <hi>David</hi> knew what good he would have, and who could ſhow it: <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</hi> Why is he ſo earneſt for this Bleſſing? <hi>Thou hast put gladneſs in my heart,</hi> (Carnal Men ſeek Gladneſs, and make it, and take it to themſelves as well as they can; But <hi>Gladneſs of God's putting in their Heart,</hi> they know not) <hi>more than in the time that their corn and their wine encreaſed. David</hi> doth not here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare (though he doth diſcover) the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Heart, with the earthlineſs of that of others; he compares not the tenderneſs of his Converſation with theirs: But he compares the Joy God gave him by the Light of his Countenance, not with the Joy he had, but with that the Ungodly have, in their ſenſual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions. Try your ſelves by this. Where is your Eſteem lodged? What ſort of things are they, that reliſh with your Spirits? Common outward Mercies carry away the Hearts of the moſt part of Men, and this ſhews, that few Men have obtained ſpecial mercy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that hath obtained <hi>ſpecial mercy, hath a love to it, and to the Giver of it, and to the way God gives it, and in which he receaves it.</hi> He that is a lover of God's mercy in <hi>Christ,</hi> is an Obtainer of it. A natural Man may have a liking of God's mercy in general; But mercy as from God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> mercy ſhown on the account of a full Satisfaction made to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in and by his Blood, mercy given freely to glorious Ends and Purpoſes, every natural Man ſeeth no Glory, no Goodneſs, no Beauty
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:93776:102" rendition="simple:additions"/> in it. But every Obtainer of it, doth admire every thing in it. It is rich mercy, ſaith he, it flows from a bleſſed Fountain, <hi>Free-love;</hi> runs in a bleſſed Channel, the <hi>Redemption of Jeſus;</hi> comes to me in a well-ordered Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and was ſhown me for his Praiſe in my Salvation from ſin and miſery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An Obtainer of mercy, is a <hi>daily Beggar for more mercy.</hi> Whenever God's ſpecial mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is taſted, hunger and thirſt after more is raiſed. No ſooner did <hi>Paul</hi> obtain mercy, but <hi>behold he prays.</hi> Acts 9.11. There is more of mercy yet to be had; mercy quickens the Soul's Deſires and enlargeth them. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Receivers are the greateſt Beggars. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2,3. <hi>Deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby, if ſo be ye have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted that the Lord is gracious.</hi> This Mark is plain, and will never fail. They that drive not a Trade of Prayer for ſpecial mercy, have not yet obtained it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. An Obtainer of mercy from the Lord, is <hi>a ſhower of mercy to others.</hi> He is a merciful Man to others. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12,13. <hi>Put on therefore (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, forgiving, as Chriſt forgave you.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.32. <hi>even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> How unbecoming it is, that ſuch ſhould have Bowels of Braſs, on whom God's Bowels of mercy have been poured out? This is a Mark that will never fail, but in a high fit of Temptation: All that have obtained God's mercy, will be diſpoſed to ſhew their mercy; <hi>Forgiving one another</hi> is an eaſie thing, it coſts

                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:93776:104" rendition="simple:additions"/> nothing but to think a kind thought: Yet how hard is this to many, through the power of Corruption? There are ſome acts of mercy, as Bounty and Charity, that poor Chriſtians have no ability for. But the principal Act of mercy, is in every Chriſtians Power; and that is, mercy to Mens Souls. We cannot give them that mercy we have obtained, but we can and ſhould wiſh the like to them. Never did a Man obtain mercy from the Lord for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he wiſheth that others ſhould partake of it alſo. The <hi>Woman of Samaria,</hi> John 4. (of whoſe Converſion we have the largeſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any <hi>Convert</hi> in the <hi>Bible</hi>) as ſoon as ſhe obtained mercy (ſhe forgot what ſhe came to the Well for, ſhe had got ſomewhat better than the Water of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well, ſhe met with <hi>Jacob's God,</hi> and had got <hi>Jacob's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>) ſhe goes to the City, and turns a ſort of a Preacher to them: <hi>Come, ſee a man that told me all things that ever I did. Is not this the Chriſt? ver.</hi> 29. She obtained mercy, and would have all the City come and get mercy alſo: And a great many came and obtained mercy. <hi>Chriſt</hi> caught that Woman by his Grace, and made her as a <hi>Bait</hi> to catch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. No Believer can deny his ſenſe of ſuch a Frame as this. There are ſome Perſons thou doſt love and ſhouldſt love; thou prayeſt for them: What doſt thou mainly ask for Wife, Children, Brothers, Siſters, and all or any thou loveſt heartily? Is it not, O that they might ſhare in God's ſaving mercy? If thou ask it for others as the greateſt mercy, thou thy ſelf art an Obtainer of mercy. <hi>Paul</hi> obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:93776:104" rendition="simple:additions"/> He loved his Countrymen the <hi>Jews</hi> dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and on good grounds. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1.5. What prays he for them? <hi>Roin.</hi> 10.1. <hi>My hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved.</hi> All right Prayer ſhould be the Hearts deſire; Salvation is the beſt thing we can pray for, to our ſelves, or to them we love. And no Man can heartily pray for Salvation to others, who hath not got it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I would now direct ſome Words to them that have obtained mercy and know it. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the Lord, that there are not a few in the World, not a few in this City, and, I hope, not a few in this Meeting, that have obtained mercy of the Lord, and know it alſo: Who can remember when their miſery was great, and when the mercy of the Lord made a viſit to them, and what great things it brought to them, and wrought in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let ſuch <hi>be very thankful for ſpecial ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy.</hi> Praiſe is a great Debt, as well as a great Bleſſing. Let none take this as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Duty; but let all Chriſtians know, that the main point of the Life and Practice of Chriſtianity lies in the performance of it. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Praiſe ſhould riſe according to the worth of what we praiſe for. Greateſt Favours call for higheſt Praiſes; and ſpecial mercy from the Lord is the higheſt favour. It is a good Cuſtom, and a Duty alſo, that people, when they receave their daily bread from God, do give him thanks for it, as well as beg his Bleſſing on it. Pray then, how do you think the Lord will take unthankfulneſs for his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:93776:105"/> mercy? How many hath the Lord to give in this Charge againſt? <q rend="inline">I never gave thee a nights reſt, but thou gave me thanks for it in the morning; but I have by my mercy raiſed thee up to newneſs of Life, and I was never thanked for it. I never fed thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but thou bleſſed me for my Bounty; but I have given thee my Son for the bread of thy Soul, but no praiſe for this Gift. When thou waſt near death, I did in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy reſtore thee, and was praiſed for it; but ſpecial mercy hath delivered thy Soul from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction; but when didſt thou praiſe for that?</q> Have a care this Charge be not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt you. Live to his Praiſe, and let Praiſe be the main Work of your Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Walk tenderly under God's ſpecial mercy.</hi> The more ſpecial the mercy be, the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully it ſhould be improved. God's ſaving mercy is a Load, a Burthen, not indeed hard to be born, but it is hard to bear it aright. A Burden that will not break the Back, but will weigh heavy on the Shoulders of the Bearers; and ſuch as are under it, are in no ſmall danger of ſtumbling. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.15. <hi>What ſhall I ſay? he hath both ſpoken unto me, and himſelf hath done it: I ſhall go ſoftly all my years in the bitterneſs of my Soul:</hi> And that there was ſpecial mercy in his Eye, ſee ver. 17. <hi>Thou haſt in love to my Soul delivered it from the pit of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy back.</hi> Here is a right ſenſe of mercy, and a good Reſolution about the guiding of it. I will walk ſoftly all the Years (fifteen of them) that God hath added to my Life. But what
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:93776:105"/> performance was there? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25. <hi>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done to him; for his heart was lifted up.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Obtainers of mercy ſhould <hi>ask grace to guide mercy;</hi> and ask it the more earneſtly and confidently, becauſe they have obtained mercy. Be not diſcouraged in asking more mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have made ſo poor improvements of what you have received. Every mercy lays us under an Obligation for more ſervice, and Grace to enable for that Service, muſt be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and therefore ſhould be asked. We need mercy, God gives it; when we get it, we ſhould guide it well; and in order to that we muſt beg more: <hi>New mercy</hi> to enable us to guide the <hi>old.</hi> No mercy from the Lord, but it may be ill guided, but the laſt, eternal Life, <hi>Jude</hi> 21. A Chriſtian is not out of all danger of abuſing any mercy of the Lord, till he receave <hi>perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy</hi> in Heaven.</p>
               <p>To them <hi>that have not obtained mercy,</hi> or at leaſt do not <hi>know that they have,</hi> only four things I would ſay to ſuch. <hi>Ask mercy, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave mercy, Plead mercy, Hope in his mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Ask mercy.</hi> The Lord hath <hi>two</hi> deſigns in offering and diſpenſing his mercy to Men: To be honoured by the <hi>Prayers of them that want it,</hi> and to be glorified by the <hi>Praiſes of them that get it.</hi> This Duty of asking mercy, is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded by the Lord, commonly practis'd by his people, and never in vain. 1. <hi>Ask mercy like it ſelf.</hi> Ask ſome way according to your Need and its Worth. If our begging
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:93776:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> bore any tolerable proportion to the great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God's ſaving mercy, what mighty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would there be? Let not mercy be ſought as a ſmall thing; it's the one thing needful, and it's the one thing we ſhould ſeek of the Lord. <hi>God's mercy, Saving mercy, Free mercy, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy great, vaſtly above all our miſery,</hi> O how would it be asked, if asked like it ſelf! 2. <hi>Ask mercy at the right Door.</hi> There is not a Crumb of ſaving mercy, that comes to any periſhing Sinner, but by <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> There is no Corn in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but what comes through this <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Hand. He is a mad Beggar of mercy, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. <hi>Ask mercy in God's time.</hi> He that commands us to ask, and tells us at what Door to beg, and promiſeth to give, tells us alſo when we ſhould ask. Men have their times; as in great diſtreſs, when dying, and at Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beware of putting off <hi>asking,</hi> till God's time of <hi>giving</hi> be paſt. It is an awful Word of <hi>Chriſt, Luke</hi> 13.25. <hi>When once the maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. There are two ſad <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> here: <hi>Beginning to ſtand without when the door is ſhut;</hi> ſuch will eternally ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: <hi>Beginning to knock at the door:</hi> Such as begin to knock at God's ſhut Door, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get in: There is no good anſwer to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God to ſuch, for eternity. Is not that a very unhappy beginning? So our Lord tells us in the Parable of the <hi>Ten Virgins,</hi> Matth. 25.10. The fooliſh came when the Door was ſhut. They were <hi>fooliſh</hi> that they came <hi>no ſooner,</hi> and <hi>miſerable</hi> that they came <hi>too late.</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:93776:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> I believe the <hi>Damned</hi> will ſee more of the <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs</hi> of the <hi>Saved,</hi> than the <hi>Saved</hi> will ſee of the <hi>Miſery</hi> of the <hi>Damned. Chriſt</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aggravates the miſery of the <hi>Damned,</hi> by what they ſhall ſee of the Bliſs of the <hi>Saved, Luke</hi> 13.28. But all we ſee in the Word, that the <hi>Saved</hi> ſhall ſee or hear of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Damned,</hi> is their <hi>Reſurrection to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> John 5.29. (which is a moſt miſerable one; better were it for them to have their Bodies lye eternally in the Grave, than to be raiſed for Damnation) their <hi>Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> and their <hi>vain Pleas and Pleadings for mercy.</hi> But O that Men would come in at God's time, and cry for mercy, as they will do out of time! How much better would it be for them? God's time is <hi>now,</hi> to <hi>day,</hi> the <hi>preſent time.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. <hi>Now is the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time, now is the day of Salvation.</hi> If Men refuſe God's mercy in his <hi>time,</hi> he will deny his mercy when ſought <hi>in their time,</hi> and out of his. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. <hi>He waits to be gracious, and willing to be exalted in having mercy.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the mercy with the Lord, all the mercy that is offered in the Promiſe; the Lord never promiſed a Sinner his mercy <hi>to morrow.</hi> If you will beg his mercy to day, you may have it, and it ſhall endure for ever. But God never gave an Allowance and Liberty to any Man, to ſpend one Day or Hour in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting whether he ſhould beg God's mercy or not. <hi>David</hi> had indeed a ſad choice of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laid before him. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.13. and is bid by the Prophet, <hi>Adviſe now, and ſee what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer I ſhall return to him that ſent me.</hi> But
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:93776:107"/> for a periſhing Sinner, that hath an Offer of God's mercy in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay allowed; but only he is bid, <hi>ask it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Receave God's mercy. Receaving</hi> is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>asking. Asking</hi> requires ſome pains; <hi>Receaving</hi> is but a conſent of the Heart to take what is offered. <hi>Asking ſuppoſeth</hi> a great and needful Bleſſing, that he that wants it, would fain have, and therefore he begs it. <hi>Receav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> implies that this great Bleſſing is in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer fully and freely, and therefore he muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it. Here is the State of things betwixt God and Men in the Goſpel. The Lord brings his mercy near to them, offers it to them, bids them take and receave it; but many will not. God offers <hi>Quarter</hi> to Rebels in Arms againſt him; but they ſtand upon their Sword, and will not take Quarter. Miniſters Work is to entreat and beſeech in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſtead. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. God only can perſwade and prevail with Men. Mercy comes prepared and ready for Men. It is prepared in <hi>the Purchaſe of Chriſt;</hi> it is prepared in the <hi>well-ordered Covenant,</hi> and as prepared and ready, it is tendered freely to Sinners. <hi>All things are ready, Come to the Marriage,</hi> Matth. 22.4. All things are ready; God himſelf is ready to give mercy; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ready, <hi>he is ſlain for us, let us come and keep the Feaſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7,8 The Holy Spirit is ready to <hi>ſeal you to the Day of Redemption,</hi> if you will accept of God's mercy in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Heaven is ready, the Way is plain, and all hinderances of Law and Juſtice remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19,20. The City of Refuge
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:93776:107"/> is ready, and its Gates are open continually, to receave and give entrance to all that flee for ſafety. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. Alas! all things are ready, but Men are not willing; there is not a moments time needed to ripen God's mercy for Men. No periſhing Sinner, that ſeeth his need of God's Mercy, and is willing to receave it, needs ſtay a moment till mercy be ready for him, or he more ready for it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. <hi>The Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is of Faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe</hi> (how very few have Ears to hear ſuch a Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſuch a Speech?) <hi>Say not in thine heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? (that is to bring Christ dowu from above?) Or who ſhall deſcend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead.) Christ</hi> is come down already from Heaven, and is gone back again to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. ver. 7. <hi>But what ſaith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the word of Faith which we preach.</hi> Mercy and Salvation for loſt Sinners is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming down and going up again; and he hath lodg'd the Power and Vertue of his Undertaking, in the Goſpel; ſuck at that Well with Faith, and thy Soul ſhall be ſaved; There thou wilt find Chriſt and <hi>all his fulneſs.</hi> There was never ſuch a Treaty made in the World: We can fetch no Similitude fully like this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men. Thus the Lord pleads with Men in the Goſpel: <q rend="inline">You are already un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done with ſin and miſery lying on you, and you are every hour ſinking into greater: Let but my mercy in my Son enter in, and it will cure all that is paſt and preſent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all the miſery that is coming on you.</q>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:93776:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> And will not miſerable Sinners receave God's mercy? Are you afraid of ſaving mercy? Will it hurt you? Why do ye not give it entrance? It is one of the greateſt demonſtrations, what Monſters ſin hath made Men, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be ſaved by free mercy in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Open a Door for God's mercy, by a free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaving of it, or elſe you will find the Door of his mercy ſhut againſt you, when you need it moſt. Your giving way to his mercy, is your receaving of it. Say with the Heart, <hi>Let God's mercy enter in upon me, and ſave me its own way.</hi> A yielding, and giving, and putting of a loſt Soul into the hand of Chriſt, is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſaving Faith in him. Will ye not truſt in his mercy? Is it not able to ſave you? Your <hi>want of a ſenſe of your need of his mercy,</hi> is a giving the lie to all the <hi>Threatenings and Curſe of the Law: Your doubting of the Ability of his mercy to ſave you,</hi> is to give the lie to all the <hi>Faithfulneſs and Truth of God, declared and ſworn in the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Plead mercy.</hi> When you beg it, uſe no other Plea for mercy, but mercy. When you beg mercy, you muſt beg mercy only for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's ſake. That that moves God to ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, muſt be our Argument in pleading for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Wherefore doth God ſhow mercy? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will ſhow mercy, <hi>and delights in it. Micah.</hi> 7.18. and therefore ſhould we plead it. Mercy in his Heart, is the only ſpring of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from his Hand. <hi>David,</hi> who knew God's mercy well, had taſted of it often, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it greatly, when fallen into a foul Pit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1. thus pleads for mercy: <hi>Have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93776:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> me, O God, according to thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my tranſgreſſions.</hi> Have a care of making any other Plea for mercy from the Lord, but that of mercy with him: And ſtick to this Plea, and it will prevail. If the Lord for trying of your Faith, or Satan for ſhaking it, ſhould ſay, How dare ſuch a vile ſinner as thou art, beg ſo great a Gift as ſaving mercy, from ſo holy a God? The poor Pleader hath a ready anſwer: <q rend="inline">I want mercy as much as my Soul is worth; in vain do I ſeek it of any Creature, nothing but his mercy can ſave me. I beg mercy only for mercy's ſake; I bring nothing but a ſtarving Soul, and an empty hand; I beg his mercy as an Alms, which will eternally enrich the Receaver, and not impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh the Giver. What can ſuch as I, beg of ſuch a God as he is, but mercy? His Name is <hi>Mercy,</hi> my Name is <hi>Miſery.</hi> I would have my miſery relieved by his mercy, and his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy glorified in my relief.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Hope in his mercy.</hi> Pſal. 147.11. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy,</hi> Pſal. 130.7. <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy.</hi> It is from the Devil, for whom there is no mercy, that any of the moſt miſerable out of Hell, are tempted to think there is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with God for them. He envies Men God's mercy; he doth not only tempt to ſin, but alſo to ſecurity in it, till the day of mercy be paſt. If God awaken a ſinner to ſee his need of mercy in time, Satan tempts them to think that it is out of time. In ſuch temptations he acts moſt like himſelf,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:93776:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> a <hi>reprobate damned Spirit;</hi> and in managing of them he hath great advantages, from his own Craft, and Malice, and Men's juſt deſerving of Wrath. Look on all ſuch Thoughts as from that Adverſary, and treat them accordingly. When you beg mercy, look for it: Expect to obtain it, when you would lay hold on it. The Lord will never keep back his ſaving mercy from a ſinner that would have it as his life. When you plead for mercy for mercy's ſake, hope to prevail, and that will help you to plead bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>So much for this Exhortation. Will ye go home and do ſo? Will you ſtudy more your miſery, and the greatneſs of his mercy? and ask and plead for it more earneſtly. There is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver better fruit of Preaching, than when the Hearers are ſent away hungering and thirſting after the Lord's mercy.</p>

               <p>I Have ſpoke to the firſt of the Bleſſings to be got at the Throne of Grace, which we ſhould come for, <hi>Obtaining of mercy.</hi> The ſecond is the <hi>finding of Grace, to help in time of need.</hi> This Expreſſion <hi>finding of Grace,</hi> is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly borrowed from the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the beſtowing of Favour is uſually ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. We find it in Mens Pleadings with one another. So <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 32.5. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.8. <hi>Theſe are to find grace in the ſight
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:93776:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> my Lord.</hi> And he pleads upon it, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>If I have found grace in thy ſight, then receave my preſent at my hand, for therefore I have ſeen thy face, as though I had ſeen the face of God, and thou waſt pleaſed with me. Jacob</hi> had ſeen God's Face that morning, and had found grace in his ſight, and he remembers it when he finds grace in the ſight of his <hi>angry Brother.</hi> So we find the Phraſe uſed in dealing with God, by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Exod. 33.12,13. <hi>Yet thou haſt ſaid, I know thee by name, and thou haſt ſound grace in my ſight. Now therefore, I pray thee, If I have found grace in thy ſight, ſhew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing I would remark here, is, the Connexion betwixt theſe two Bleſſings and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands, <hi>Obtaining of Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Finding of Grace.</hi> Mercy and Grace are joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God, and are not to be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder by Man. Many would ſeparate them; they would be content to obtain mercy, but they care not ſo much for his grace. But ſuch are only profane ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that know neither God nor themſelves, nor his Mercy nor his Grace. The Lord will not give Mercy without Grace, nor Grace without Mercy; all that receave either, receave both; and all that would have either, muſt ask both; and none can ask either aright, but he that asks both.</p>
               <p>This Grace we are called to come to the Throne of Grace for the finding of, is ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from its great advantage and uſefulneſs: It is Grace <hi>to help in time of need.</hi> The Words
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:93776:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the Original are, Grace for <hi>ſeaſonable, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune help.</hi> It is the nature of this Grace, that it is helpful; its helpfulneſs mainly appears in a time of need: A <hi>time of need</hi> will come; this Grace is to be asked before that time come, it is to be waited upon till the <hi>time of need</hi> come, and uſed when it comes.</p>
               <p>The Truth to be ſpoke to, is this plain one: <hi>That all that hear of God's Offer of Grace, ſhould come to God to ask it, to get it, to find it.</hi> Men ſhould come to God's Throne of Grace, for Grace for themſelves. They ſhould come to God in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> for the Grace of God in and by <hi>Christ Jeſus.</hi> This is a Truth ſo bright in its own evidence, that there is no need to confirm it. What hath been ſaid of <hi>coming to obtain mercy,</hi> is equally binding unto <hi>coming to find Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things then I would ſpeak unto at this time. 1. What is <hi>this Grace</hi> we are called to come to the Throne of Grace for. 2. What <hi>finding of Grace</hi> is; what ſpecialty is there in this expreſſion. It is certain, never did a Man <hi>find Grace,</hi> before <hi>Grace found him.</hi> Grace is always the <hi>firſt finder:</hi> But the ſenſe of it, and our knowledge of our having found it, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What <hi>is this Grace</hi> we are to come to the Throne of Grace for finding of. We have need to know this diſtinctly. The reaſon why many are ſo confuſed, and dark, and barren in their Prayers, is, becauſe they know not what is to be got by Prayer. If we had a a clear knowledge of the full extent of this Grace, that is to be diſpenſed at this Throne
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:93776:111"/> of Grace, we ſhould quickly know what to ask, and find matter for asking continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Grace of God,</hi> that we are invited to come to the throne of grace for finding of, comes under <hi>three</hi> different Conſiderations. 1. As it is in the <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence it <hi>flows.</hi> 2. As it is in the <hi>Channel</hi> in which it <hi>runs.</hi> 3. As it is in the <hi>Veſſels</hi> that do <hi>receave</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Grace conſidered as in <hi>the Fountain from whence it flows,</hi> is <hi>Grace in God.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures take notice of the ſpecial Intereſt that each of the <hi>Three bleſſed Perſons of the Godhead</hi> have in the diſpenſing of Grace. We find the <hi>Father</hi> called the <hi>God of all Grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.10. and there <hi>Chriſt</hi> is alſo named, and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> implyed. The <hi>Father,</hi> the God of all Grace is the <hi>Caller,</hi> he calleth us to <hi>his eternal Glory</hi> by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> we are fitted for the poſſeſſion of it by the Grace of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is oft ſpoke of, as the Fountain of Grace. <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>Full of Grace and Truth;</hi> and that we might know that this Fountain-fulneſs in him, is for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>And out of his Fulneſs have all we receaved, and grace for grace.</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghoſt is called the ſpirit of grace.</hi> Heb. 10.29. <hi>of grace and ſupplication.</hi> Zech. 12.10. <hi>Of Faith.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. When we come to the throne of grace, for grace in this Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we come for the manifeſtation and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of grace from the Fountain, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Will and our Need, for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of our Salvation to the Praiſe of his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93776:111" rendition="simple:additions"/> grace. It is to be obſerved in that <hi>Apoſtolick Wiſh,</hi> which by a good Cuſtom is made the <hi>concluding Bleſſing</hi> in Chriſtian Aſſemblies. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>The grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the holy Ghoſt, be with you all, Amen,</hi> That there is <hi>grace</hi> in the <hi>Fathers love,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as well as there is <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Grace of our Lord Jeſus.</hi> For grace is in all divine Favour and in all its Fruits, freely beſtowed on the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Sons of Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace may be conſidered as it is in <hi>the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in which it runs,</hi> in the Way and Means of its conveyance, uſually called the <hi>means of grace,</hi> and this is the Goſpel. It's true, that this form of ſpeech, <hi>means of grace,</hi> is not a Scriptural Phraſe, though it be uſual with us. But by it, we mean nothing, but ſuch means, as are hallowed by Divine Inſtitution, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a gracious Promiſe of beſtowing grace on the right Uſers thereof; the main of which means, is the Goſpel it ſelf, called by <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. <hi>the Goſpel of the grace of God.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 32. <hi>the word of his grace.</hi> And in <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. the Goſpel is called ſimply, <hi>the grace of God.</hi> If you take away the Doctrine of <hi>Free grace,</hi> you take away the Goſpel. It is but an empty Shadow, a falſe Name, to call that Doctrine, <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that is not the <hi>Word of his grace.</hi> The grace of God in the means, is univerſally offered to all that hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Goſpel, but the Bleſſing it ſelf is ſovereignly diſpenſed, like grace. There is ground ſufficient in the Promiſe, for Faith in waiting on the Lord in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93776:112" rendition="simple:additions"/> the uſe of his Appointments: But yet the Lord never uſed any outward mean, that was always effectual to all them that had it. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of any outward means that ever Men were under, was the <hi>perſonal miniſtry of Chriſt,</hi> yet all his Hearers did not believe, yea, but a few did. <hi>John</hi> 6.26, &amp;c. What a heavenly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> deliver? but what was the effect of it? <hi>ver.</hi> 66. <hi>From that time many of his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.</hi> The Lord hath wiſely ordered it thus, that the means (the Channel his grace runs in) are at ſome times, and to ſome Perſons, filled with his grace; and at other times, are but empty Pipes, that the <hi>means</hi> themſelves may not be doated on, and that the <hi>Fountain</hi> may ſtill be depended on. When then we come to the throne of grace, for Grace <hi>as in the means,</hi> we come begging, that the Lord who hath appointed the means, and keeps the Bleſſing of them in his own Hand, would fill the means with his Grace, and fill our Souls with the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of that grace, in our uſe of theſe means.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grace is conſidered as it is <hi>in the Veſſels</hi> that receave it, in Men that partake of it. And here it will be needful to diſtinguiſh. The grace of God as receaved, comes under a very notable diſtinction, of <hi>common grace</hi> and <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace,</hi> or <hi>ſpecial.</hi> Somewhat hath been hinted of the ſame diſtinction, betwixt <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſpecial ſaving mercy.</hi> But of this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to <hi>grace receaved,</hi> I would ſpeak more fully.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:93776:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Common Grace,</hi> is ſo called, not becauſe it is ordinary and uſual (for in bad times it is rare enough) but becauſe it is not <hi>ſaving.</hi> It's moſt likely, that in ſuch happy times (which we cannot now boaſt of, but only hope for) when <hi>ſaving grace</hi> is beſtowed on many, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace</hi> is diſpenſed more frequently alſo. That there is ſuch a thing as <hi>common Grace,</hi> is as certain, as it is, that there is ſuch a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (if I may ſo call him) as a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> or in the <hi>World.</hi> For an <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite</hi> is nothing elſe, but <hi>an unrenewed ſinner painted over with more or leſs common Grace.</hi> And to Men that ſee the out-ſide of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers only, he may appear like a true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would give ſome particular Inſtances of this common grace. 1. There is a common <hi>enlightening grace,</hi> a common Illumination. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. and 10.26. the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth that there is an <hi>enlightening,</hi> and a <hi>receaving a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth</hi> that may be, where a fatal Apoſtacy may follow. The Lord may give the Light of his Word, and in, and by that Light, may dart in ſome clear Beams of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Truth, on ſuch that are led no further. It is far from being true, that all <hi>knowing Heads have ſound Hearts.</hi> There may be, and often is, much clear Light in the mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout points of ſaving Truth, when there is no Senſe, no Savor, no Faith in the Heart. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. We find <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking in the moſt noble Aſſembly, that it's like he ever ſpoke in. A <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> and a <hi>Roman Governour,</hi> greater than both. In this Auguſt Aſſembly, <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:93776:113"/> though a Priſoner in Bonds, remembers his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Apoſtle, and preacheth Chriſt, and takes <hi>Christ's grace</hi> in converting him, for his <hi>Text. ver.</hi> 24. <hi>When he is thus ſpeaking, Feſtus ſaid with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beſide thy ſelf, much learning hath made thee mad.</hi> At the ſame time, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Agrippa ſaid unto Paul, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian.</hi> This was a great deal better then <hi>Feſtus</hi>'s Word; yet a poor Word in it ſelf. It ſpoke ſome glancing of ineffectual Light on his mind. An <hi>Almoſt Chriſtian, and no more,</hi> is but a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>almoſt ſaved and no more:</hi> or one that is <hi>no Chriſtian, and never ſaved at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is common <hi>awakening grace.</hi> The Lord ſometimes alarms the Conſciences of the Ungodly, and may raiſe a great Senſe of Sin, in ſuch as are never forgiven; and fears of Hell, yea a fore-taſt of Hell, in ſome that never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape it. <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pharaoh: I have ſinned,</hi> ſaith <hi>Saul: I have ſinned,</hi> ſaith <hi>Judas, in betraying innocent blood.</hi> Alas! poor wretch; it had been better to have confeſs'd his Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Maſter, to his Maſter, than to his <hi>Murderers. Felix</hi> trembled when <hi>Paul</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It was grace in God, to come ſo near to him, and great Power was put forth: What elſe could make ſuch a great <hi>Prince,</hi> as <hi>Felix</hi> was, to tremble at the Words of a poor <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſtanding before him in his Chains? <hi>Awakening grace</hi> is but <hi>common grace.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> wounds many a Conſcience that the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> doth not heal; becauſe not applyed to. No Wound can the Law make, which the Goſpel cannot heal. Boaſt not of your Wounds
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:93776:113"/> by the Law, unleſs you can tell how you were healed. There is no cure for a Conſcience wounded by Sin and the Law, but the <hi>Blood of Jeſus</hi> ſhed for Sin. Did ye come to it? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. Did he apply it to you? Were you cured of your Wounds before ye went to him, and before he came to you? Woful is that Cure, and worſe than the Wound. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor Creatures are wounded by the Law, and to the Law they go for Healing. But God never appointed the Law to heal a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience, and it never did, nor can, nor will, to the end of the World, nor to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It is <hi>Chriſt's</hi> name, and property, and glory, to be the only <hi>Phyſician</hi> of Souls; and all muſt die of the <hi>Diſeaſe of Sin,</hi> that are not his <hi>happy Patients.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is common <hi>restraining grace.</hi> An Act of God's grace and wiſdom, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten puts forth in his ruling of this wicked World. How quickly would this. Earth become a Hell, were it not for this reſtraining grace? If all unrenewed Men were permitted by God, to commit all the Sin Satan tempts to, and their Natures incline them to, there would be no living in this World for the golly. This reſtraining grace we find a <hi>Heathen</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. <hi>I with-held thee from ſinning againſt me,</hi> faith the Lord to <hi>Abimelech.</hi> And which is more, we find a <hi>great Saint</hi> praying for it. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Keep back thy ſervant alſo from preſumptuous ſins, let them not have Dominion over me:</hi> That is, lay a powerful reſtraint on me by thy grace, that when I am tempted, my way may be hedged up, and I may be kept from
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:93776:114"/> complying with the Temptation. But yet <hi>bare reſtraining grace</hi> is not deſired by a Chriſtian in good caſe, without ſanctifying grace: He deſires not only the reſtraining of the outward Acts of Sin, but the removing of inward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, to Sin; he begs the renewing and changing of the Heart. So <hi>David,</hi> when he had fallen foully, by the ſtrength of inward Corruption, and God's leaving him to himſelf; when recovered by Grace, and renewed unto Repentance, prays like a wiſe Believer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There is common <hi>aſſiſting grace.</hi> Many a bad Man hath had good Aſſiſtance from God in a good Work. The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath cloathed many, and enabled them to great and good Works, which God gets Service by, and the World good by, though the Doers thereof be not accepted. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many ſhall ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name? and in thy name have caſt out devils? and in thy name have done many wonderful works?</hi> All great things, and all done in <hi>Chriſt's Name,</hi> and done by <hi>his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</hi> In their <hi>caſting out of Devils,</hi> and in <hi>working of Miracles,</hi> there was an exerting of Omnipotency, with and by their Faith, which is the greateſt divine Aſſiſtance we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. And no doubt they were aſſiſted by <hi>Chriſt's Spirit</hi> in their <hi>prophecying in his Name.</hi> Now ſuch things they thus did; <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Reply denies not their doing of them, finds no fault with the Works in themſelves, but all his Quarrel is with the Workers. <hi>I
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:93776:114"/> never knew you, you are workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. To common Grace, belongs ſome <hi>Comfort and Joy</hi> reaching the Heart in hearing the Word. Our Lord expreſly explains the <hi>Stony ground</hi> this way. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20. <hi>He that receaved the ſeed in stony places, the ſame is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receaveth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly. There is <hi>reforming grace,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to common grace. The power of the Word may come ſo on natural Mens Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that they may reform many things. As <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>Herod</hi> when he heard <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, did many things and heard him gladly.</hi> So 2 Pet. 2.20.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, What, ſhould we come to the Throne of Grace for common Grace? I anſwer, Not for it alone, but for it, and better. It is a mercy to have common grace; it is grace, that is, undeſerved; but it is a woful Snare to him that reſts in it. If the Lord reſtrain your Corruptions, if he enlighten your Minds, and awaken your Conſciences, if he aſſiſt you with Gifts for good Works, if he help you to mend any thing that is amiſs in your Converſation, bleſs him for all, but reſt not on any of theſe things. It is a higher and better Grace that is Saving, and that you muſt ſeek after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saving grace</hi> as diſtinct from, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that is <hi>common,</hi> reſpects three things.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:93776:115"/>
               <p n="1">1. It reſpects and works a <hi>change in a Man's State,</hi> which <hi>common grace</hi> never performs. <hi>Saving grace</hi> changeth a Perſon's State; by this grace an <hi>Enemy</hi> is reconciled to God, a <hi>guilty ſinner</hi> is <hi>juſtified freely</hi> through the <hi>redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> a <hi>Stranger</hi> receaves <hi>Sonſhip</hi> by <hi>Chriſt. Common Grace</hi> never alters the State of a Man's Perſon, but it leaves him where it found him; it never doth, nor can, take him out of the old Stock of <hi>fallen. Adam,</hi> he ſtill lyes in that Pit, and is never by it tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and engraffed in him as a new Head. But <hi>ſaving grace,</hi> when it comes, doth all, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4,18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saving grace reſpects <hi>Man's ſinful nature, and changeth it.</hi> And this grace, thus work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is called <hi>Regenerating, Sanctifying,</hi> and <hi>renewing of Men. Chriſt</hi> calls it, <hi>being born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> John 3.3. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt</hi> through this grace, <hi>he is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. This the Apoſtle calls, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of Regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Natural Men are apter to look to their <hi>Converſation,</hi> than to their <hi>Nature.</hi> They may ſee many things amiſs in their <hi>way,</hi> who are loath to look into their Heart, and if Light ſhine in to diſcover inward Heart-faults, they are ſtill backward to own that all is naught, and that there is no good in their Hearts. If the Light purſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> them yet cloſer, and make them ſee that all is ſtark naught within, they are ſtill more backward to own the true Spring of their Diſeaſe, and the true Remedy for it: That all this Dominion of Sin
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:93776:115"/> over them, flows from the natural State of their Perſons, as ſtanding ſtill in, and under the firſt <hi>ſinful Adam,</hi> and can never be altered and mended, but by Grace putting them into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the Root of their New Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saving grace reſpects and works on <hi>the new Nature.</hi> Special grace not only changeth a Man's State, nor his old corrupt Nature on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, but it works on this new Nature wrought by Grace. The ſpecial Operation of the grace of God in and from the Fountain, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own new Creation in the Hearts of his Children. We cannot conceave it fully, our Minds are not able take in theſe depths of God. We hear from, and read in the Word, of the intimate Correſpondence the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains with them in whom he dwells. <hi>Chriſt dwells in the heart by faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17. <hi>His Spirit dwells in his people,</hi> Rom. 5 9,10,11. But what is it in their Hearts that he dwells in? He dwells in his own <hi>Workmanſhip</hi> in their Hearts, in his own <hi>new Creation,</hi> in his own Garden he hath planted in them. There his Preſence is, and there his Eye is, on that his hand is; this is that he waters, and carefully looks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. When a Believer comes to the Throne of grace for this grace, he comes to beg that the new Creation in him, may be viſited, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtrengthened, and brought to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. They that have no planting of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them, want this Errand to the Throne of Grace, that Believers daily come upon.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:93776:116"/>
               <p>So much for the firſt thing, What this grace is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is the <hi>finding of this grace;</hi> why the Apoſtle uſeth this Phraſe, different from the former, about mercy? That was <hi>obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mercy,</hi> this is <hi>finding of grace. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> are near a-kin, and ſo is <hi>obtaining</hi> and <hi>finding.</hi> Beſides the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Phraſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked already, theſe things I would note in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I conceave that this Phraſe of <hi>finding grace</hi> doth imply the Duty of <hi>ſeeking it:</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Lord's own direction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you: Seek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> Where, and in <hi>ver.</hi> 8. our Lord gives three Commands to one Duty of Prayer, under three ſeveral Names, and ſix Promiſes for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, under three different Names al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, redoubled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This form of ſpeaking, points forth <hi>the giving and beſtowing of Grace.</hi> His Grace and Favour is what is given to, beſtowed on, and enjoyed by them that come to the throne of grace. When the old World was exceeding bad, all ſtark naught, and but one good Man in it (you muſt needs think that it was a bad World then) and that was <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 6.8. <hi>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.</hi> This Word we ſhould regard the more, that it is the firſt place where the <hi>grace of God</hi> is mentioned in Scripture. <hi>Thee have' I ſeen righteous before me in this generation,</hi> ſaith the Lord to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. And how this Man came by his Righteouſneſs, ſee in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93776:116"/> 
                  <hi>By Faith Noe being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark for the ſaving of his houſe, by the which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the World, and became Heir of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi> Who but the Spirit of God by <hi>Paul</hi> (who I think was the Pen-man of this <hi>Epiſtle.</hi>) would have found the Righteouſneſs of Faith in <hi>Noah's</hi> building of the <hi>Ark?</hi> Many, nay, moſt of Men, called Chriſtians, cannot ſee this Righteouſneſs that is by Faith, in the Goſpel it ſelf. There was a brave inheritance and Eſtate in this <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith,</hi> ſecured and revealed in the <hi>firſt Goſpel,</hi> Gen. 3.15. Of this Eſtate <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> were poſſeſſed, and <hi>Noah became,</hi> that is, declared himſelf an Heir of it, by his Faith and the Fruits of it. The whole World had the Warning, <hi>Noah</hi> from God, the World by <hi>Noah;</hi> all were equally concerned in the danger: <hi>Noah</hi> preached it to them, and God's Spirit was with him, ſtriving with them 120 Years. But not one Man found grace, but he alone. A prodigious depth of Judgment and Mercy. Such a Man a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Noah,</hi> preached ſo long to a <hi>world of the ungodly,</hi> as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. and not one ſingle Man or Woman believed. He only <hi>found grace in the eyes of the Lord.</hi> Jer. 31.2. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the people that were left of the Sword, found grace in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, even Iſrael, when I went to cauſe him to reſt.</hi> It is a great bleſſing to <hi>find grace</hi> any where; but to find grace in the <hi>Wilderneſs;</hi> to find grace where, and when, the <hi>Sword</hi> of God's Anger and Juſtice is deſtroying multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, is heightened grace. Grace falls ſtill

               <p n="3">3. In this Phraſe of <hi>finding grace,</hi> there may this be conceaved, if you will underſtand it rightly, the <hi>Caſualty of the getting of grace.</hi> There is no ſuch thing as <hi>Caſualty</hi> to God: He always knows when, and where, and on whom, to beſtow his grace: But the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his grace is a meer Caſualty to all Men, both to them that receave it, and to others that look on. My meaning is, grace comes <hi>unlooked for, undeſerved, undeſtred, unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> in its firſt viſit eſpecially. So that all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavers of it may ſay as <hi>Hagar,</hi> the only good Word we have of that Bond-woman. <hi>Gen</hi> 16.13. <hi>And ſhe called the name of the Lord that ſpake to her, Thou God ſeeſt me</hi> (happy are they that can name God from his grace and mercy to them. <hi>David</hi> calls him, <hi>the God of my mercy,</hi> Pſal. 59.10,17.) <hi>for ſhe ſaid, Have I alſo here looked after him, that ſeeth me?</hi> The Lord hath had his Eye on me for good, when I was not thinking on him. Grace always comes at firſt by ſurprize. How many are there, that attend diligently on all the means of grace, and never find grace? When ſome that come, but by accident (as we think) grace finds them, and they find it. This is the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93776:117" rendition="simple:additions"/> hid in the Field of the Goſpel; bleſſed is he that finds it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44. Many dig in this Field, and never find the Treaſure in it. Men ſhould uſe means, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.33,34. Miniſters ſhould deſign wiſely to catch Souls, and labour painfully in it; but the Lord in his Application of his grace, paſſeth by many that we would faineſt have ſaved, and lights on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we never thought on. And let him do with his own grace as ſeemeth him good. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thought <hi>little Zacheus</hi> of Salvation, when he climb'd the Tree to ſee <hi>Jeſus</hi> paſs by, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not call'd him down, the <hi>poor rich Publican</hi> was as like as any in the Company, to have let <hi>Chriſt</hi> paſs on in his Journey. When <hi>Saul</hi> was going his wicked Journey, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. who would have thought that grace would have fallen on him as it did! All Partakers of grace, that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member its firſt Viſit, can witneſs, that their finding of grace was a meer Caſualty to them: they thought not of it, they ſought it not, yet it found them, and was found by them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me. I am found of them that ſought me not. Seeking</hi> is our Duty, and <hi>finding</hi> is our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but, both <hi>right ſeeking,</hi> and <hi>gracious find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> are ſingly owing to his grace. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, after a deep Diſcourſe of the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God in diſpenſing his grace, ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30,31. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? that the Gentiles which followed not after righteouſneſs, have attained to righteouſneſs, even the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of Faith. But Iſrael which followed after the law of righteouſneſs; hath
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93776:118"/> not attained to the law of righteouſneſs?</hi> The cauſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s miſſing Righteouſneſs, he gives, ver. 32. <hi>Becauſe they have ſought it, not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law, for they did not</hi> build and believe on <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Foundation, but <hi>ſtumbled at him</hi> as a <hi>ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtone.</hi> A moſt dreadful way of ruine, for Men to break their Necks on the <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> But the Apoſtle gives no cauſe why the <hi>Gentiles</hi> attained the Righteouſneſs of Faith; but his Diſcourſe hints it plainly. Grace ſent the Goſpel to them, and grace bleſſed it to them in working Faith in them, by the which they laid hold on the Righteouſneſs offered to them, and ſo they were poſſeſſed of it, and ſaved by that poſſeſſion.</p>

                  <hi>Appl.</hi> Should we come to the throne of grace for grace? then, 1. I infer, <hi>That every Man ſhould pray.</hi> Have you found grace already? Come for more; for more grace is needed by you, and more is to be had from the giver. It is a bleſſed Name of God, much to be called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>He giveth more grace.</hi> It is much that he giveth any grace at all; but more, that he ſtill gives <hi>more.</hi> If he gives more and more grace, you ſhould come more and more for this <hi>more grace.</hi> If you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receaved grace, you muſt come to this throne of grace, where only it is to be found. This Text hath a ſtrong Argument in it, as well as a great Encouragement. Are Men invited to the throne of grace that they may find grace? then ſurely graceleſs Folks ſhould mainly come, and have moſt need to come. You will ſay, That the Prayer of the wicked is an Abomination to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93776:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Lord: True; what then? Therefore ſay you, I ſhould not pray. A bad inference. But ſay you, were it not better that a Man ſhould mend and grow better, and then come, and not till then. This is a perverſe method, that <hi>Satan</hi> befools multitudes with. I pray you, How long may a Man be a mending himſelf, ere he be one bit better, till the grace of God come and mend him? A ſinner never doth know truly his badneſs, till he ſee it incurable by all his own doings, and that it is only curable by Sovereign grace. Men ſee a little of the fruits of ſin in their Walk; and them, or ſome of them, they think they may remove; and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they may: But the Fountain remains ſtill, and will ſend forth its Streams one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Till a Man ſee his Heart and Nature, he ſeeth but the out-ſide of ſin in himſelf. It's the ſight of ſin in our nature, of ſin as our nature, that is truly humbling; then a Man ſeeth himſelf quite loſt, and for ever undone, without any poſſible ground of hope, unleſs <hi>Almighty free grace</hi> undertake for him.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this Objection, in all its ſtrength, I ſay four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Coming to the throne of grace for grace, is required by God.</hi> He commands it as a piece of Honour to him, that all ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his grace. No ſinful or miſerable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances can be in the condition of any out of Hell, that can diſſolve Mens Obligation to this Duty. The power of ſin and guilt on an ungodly Man, diſables him quite from the right performance of any Command of God, but doth not looſe the Obligation of God's Law
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93776:119"/> upon his Conſcience. You are bound to pray, you cannot pray. This is your ſtrait, own it. Grace can only extricate you out of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secure neglect of Prayer is a great deal worſe, than a faulty-managing of it.</hi> Let ſuch Folks ſay then, I will pray, and try to pray, and though I ſhould marr twenty Prayers I will pray ſtill; for it is better to try as we can, than to neglect it quite. What know you but <hi>grace</hi> may come in, and help you, when ſinking under the weight of Prayer?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Is not that a good Prayer, and fit for your caſe?</hi> Luke 11.1. <hi>Lord teach as to pray.</hi> Lord teach us to come the right way to the throne of grace. If you can ſay no more, ſay that, and you can ſay nothing better. An humble groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to be taught by him to pray, hath more of true Prayer in it, than many fine Words, which Men call <hi>Prayer,</hi> and commend as <hi>brave praying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Is it not a throne of Grace you are called to come to, that ye may find grace?</hi> You want grace and cannot come, ſay ye; you want grace, and therefore come, ſay I. You are not to bring grace of your own working, but to find it of his giving, at this throne. Would you have grace? come and get it. Men periſh under the Goſpel, only for their refuſing of the grace of God: And juſtly are they counted Refuſers of grace, that will not come where it is to be found: And moſt righteous is their Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Inference.</hi> Should we come to the throne of grace, that we may find grace? Then <hi>Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs people are graceleſs people.</hi> Grace is only to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93776:119"/> be had at this Throne; therefore ſuch as have no buſineſs at the throne of grace, are graceleſs people. A <hi>Prayerleſs Perſon</hi> is a <hi>graceleſs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> A <hi>Prayerleſs Family</hi> is a <hi>graccleſs Family:</hi> and <hi>London</hi> would be a <hi>graceleſs City,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a <hi>graceleſs Kingdom,</hi> if there were no ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of God in them. But bleſſed be God, there are a great many: The Lord make them an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times more, and that our Eyes may ſee it, as <hi>Joab</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> about numbring of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not on thy Name. Heathens that know not God,</hi> and <hi>Families that call not on his Name,</hi> are the ſame ſort of Folks, and the ſame Wrath of God hangs over them. Wrath overtakes all that have not found grace at this throne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Inference.</hi> It follows alſo, that <hi>the moſt diligent plyers of the throne of grace are the greateſt receavers of grace, and the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavers of grace are the greateſt comers to, and uſers of the throne of grace.</hi> Would ye try the meaſures of grace receaved? Try it by your diligence in praying. Some would fain know how it is with their Souls: Here is a ſhort, plain, and ſure mark to judge it by. How goes the work of Praying? It is a better Mark, than your increaſe in Light and Knowledge of the Letter of Goſpel-Truth; better than to try your ſelves by your publick Duties, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon all outward Ordinances. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a Man can be diligent, painful, and ſerious in plying of the Throne of Grace, but there will be Grace found, more or leſs,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93776:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> of one ſort or other. Every one muſt ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 73.28. <hi>But it is good for me to draw near to God:</hi> and the oftener, the better. <hi>He hath not ſaid to us, that we ſhould ſeek his face in vain,</hi> Iſa. 45.19. And none of the Seekers of his Face dare ſay, that they do ſeek him in vain, unleſs in a fit of Temptation, when they <hi>lie against their right.</hi> It is alſo as impoſſible, that the work of Grace can proſper, when this <hi>High-way is unoccupied</hi> (sa <hi>Deborah</hi> ſings, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.6.) That Chriſtian that lets Graſs grow in the Road be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and Heaven, Rottenneſs is entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Bones, a Conſumption is coming on upon his Soul, and the <hi>holy fleſh is paſſed from him</hi> (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.15.) The Savour and Reliſh the Soul finds in approaching to the throne of grace, is the ſureſt Teſt of Soul-proſpering. In this I appeal to the Conſciences of all that ever knew Communion with God. Is it not beſt with you every way, when you are moſt with him? Do not your Burdens grow light, when you caſt them on the Lord? Is not your Path plain, when his Candle ſhineth upon you? And doth it not ſhine, when you are much in his Company? Difficulties evaniſh, and hard Work grows eaſie, when the Lord is with you, and you with him. See how the Apoſtle joyns things together. <hi>Jude.</hi> 20,21. <hi>But ye, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, building up your ſelves upon your moſt holy Faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt, keep your ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life.</hi> Your Faith, your Love, your Hope, are all to be acted in Prayer, and are cheriſhed by
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93776:120"/> Prayer, and ſtrengthened by the Anſwers of Prayer. Would you have plenty of the Grace of God? Here is a plain and ſure way taught you by the Apoſtle, and he joyns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them he exhorts: <hi>Let us come to the Throne of Grace, that we may find Grace.</hi>

               <p>THE Gracious Call and Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contained in this Text, hath been often ſpoke to. An Invitation frequently deliver'd in the preaching of the Goſpel, and as frequently flighted by moſt of the hearers of the Goſpel. It is ſuch an Invitation, as if it were delivered in the laſt day, to the miſerable Company on <hi>Chriſt's left hand,</hi> we may think what complying with it would there be; if there were a Throne of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:93776:121"/> Grace ſet up then for but one hour, where mercy and grace might be had in that time of need, Think ye not that there would be coming and crouding, and crying and roaring for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace? but that day will afford no ſuch Priviledge: Now you have it, and the Lord knows, and next to him, your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences know, how this is entertained. What this <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> is, what <hi>coming to it</hi> is, what <hi>Boldneſs in coming</hi> is allowed, what <hi>ground there is for this Boldneſs,</hi> have been ſpoke to. The laſt thing in this verſe, what <hi>Bleſſings may be had by coming,</hi> hath been ſpoke to alſo: Of the <hi>mercy</hi> to be <hi>obtained,</hi> and of the <hi>grace</hi> to be <hi>found.</hi> Of this laſt, I have handled two things. 1. What is the <hi>grace</hi> that is to be found. 2. What the Phraſe of <hi>find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace</hi> imports.</p>
               <p>There are two things more that remain in the Text. 1. The <hi>Helpfulneſs of this grace.</hi> We are called to come to <hi>find grace to help.</hi> 2. The <hi>Seaſonableneſs of this help of grace.</hi> It is grace <hi>to help in time of need.</hi> So our Tranſlation carries it, and pretty well. The Original runs in fewer Words, grace unto <hi>ſeaſonable help,</hi> or Help <hi>in due ſeaſon.</hi> Of theſe two I would ſpeak at this time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the helpfulneſs of Grace. <hi>God's grace is a moſt helpful bleſſing.</hi> 1. It is <hi>promiſed</hi> by him that gives it, as help. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: Be not diſmayed, for I am thy God: I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Alas! who hath Faith enough to draw at this deep Well
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:93776:122"/> of Salvation? Every Word hath rich Food for Faith. Whenever God would engage the Heart of a poor Creature to a dependance on him, he doth it by promiſing to be that to them, and to do that for them, that none, beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, can be, or do. No Man can truly act Faith on God for that he thinks a Creature can do for him. You never believe ſoundly, but when you look to, and wait on God for that, that is impoſſible utterly to the whole Creation, to give to you, or to do for you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, we find the <hi>Saints beg God's help.</hi> Whenever they come to God in earneſt, they come to this, <hi>Lord help,</hi> for <hi>all other help is vain.</hi> There is no more <hi>common Prayer</hi> in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> and to this day, than Prayer for the Lord's helping grace. All our Prayers, in their greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, center in this, <hi>help us by thy grace.</hi> The great Believer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.25. <hi>Came and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him, ſaying, Lord help me.</hi> A ſhort Prayer, but mighty and full of Faith. A weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Man in Faith than this Woman, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.22. <hi>Have compaſſion on us, and help us,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for himſelf and his Son. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. He prays for himſelf alone, <hi>Lord, help my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> There is no Believer on Earth, who may not daily pray this Prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>All the People of God find the helpfulneſs of his grace.</hi> All that ſeek it find it, and all that find it, find the helpfulneſs of his Grace.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:93776:122"/>
               <p>I would in a few things ſhew the helpfulneſs of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Grace of God helps always <hi>to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and effectually.</hi> This grace <hi>helped Paul to labour more abundantly than all the Apoſtles.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. I ſay not, that this is always ſenſible to the Receaver; but only that grace given is always really effectual for the end for which it is given: It is not given in vain.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The grace of God helps <hi>univerſally;</hi> there is no caſe wherein it is not helpful. As <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt we can do nothing,</hi> John 15.5. So, <hi>through him ſtrengthening,</hi> we may do <hi>all things,</hi> or <hi>any thing,</hi> Phil. 4.13. A Chriſtian can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, can foreſee no Condition, no Tryal, no Difficulty, wherein the Lord's grace cannot help him. So the Text runs, <hi>that we may find grace to help in time of need.</hi> Let the time be what it will, and the need what it will, grace can help in it. It were a ſad weakneſs of Faith for any Chriſtian to ſay, <hi>I am in that condition, that the grace of God cannot help me in.</hi> His grace is Omnipotent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grace helps <hi>ſweetly.</hi> I mean that it doth not help as an <hi>External help,</hi> but as an <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> As for a familiar Similitude. A weak and weary, or lame Perſon, may be helped by the ſtrength of another, or by being carried; but this is but <hi>external help.</hi> This weak, or lame perſon is helped far better, when his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity is removed, and new ſtrength given to him, ſo that he can pleaſantly walk and run. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.3. <hi>In the day when I cried, thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweredst me, and ſtrengthenedst me with ſtrenth
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:93776:123"/> in, my Soul.</hi> Its true, the grace of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſtrength conſiſts, is without us, and in him; but it is inwardly applyed to us, when ſtrength is found and felt. Therefore is it that Believers, not only find, by the diſpenſings of of his helping grace, an effectual ſtrength for their Work and Duty, but a great deal of ſweetneſs and eaſineſs in the exerting of that gracious help. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>I will run in the way of thy Commandments, when thou ſhalt enlarge my heart.</hi> When <hi>he draws, we run,</hi> Song 1.4. When ſuch helping Influences of grace come on Believers, holy Obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in a manner as ſweet, eaſie, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to them, as it is to a Man that hath bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſtrength, to uſe it, in ſpeaking, walking, or working. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31. <hi>They that wait upon the Lord, ſhall renew</hi> (or <hi>change</hi>) <hi>their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings as Eagles, they ſhall run and not be weary, and they ſhall walk and not faint.</hi> Pſal. 103.5. <hi>Thy youth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed like the Eagles,</hi> is one of the Notes in the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s ſweet Song. No Saint is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this in his own Experience. Who knows not, that at ſome times their Work is heavy, and is a Burden too heavy for them; at other times it is as light as a Feather, and as pleaſant and eaſie to them, as for a Bird that hath Wings, to fly?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly.</hi> The grace of God helps very <hi>myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly.</hi> Sometimes its help is very ſecret; and at other times it is very plain to be diſcovered. Its help is ſometimes ſo ſecret, that the Saints cannot know or diſcern it at preſent, but they are made to know it afterwards. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:93776:123"/> 
                  <hi>But as for me, my feet were almoſt gone; my ſteps had well nigh ſlipt, ver.</hi> 22. <hi>So fooliſh was I and ignorant: I was as a beaſt before thee.</hi> This is the account he gives of the power of the Temptation he was under, and of the bad frame it had brought upon him. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I am continually with thee: thou-haſt hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me by my right hand.</hi> He did not know this, till he was brought out of the darkneſs of the Temptation; but then he did diſcern, that there had been a ſecret ſupport given him, otherwiſe he had fallen utterly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Encouragement have we to come to the Throne of Grace for this <hi>helping Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Propoſal and Revelation made to us of this grace as helpful, is an Encouragement to come for it.</hi> Hath the Lord revealed his grace as only helpful to his people; and ſhould they not come for that help? Your Faith is not very ſtrong and active, unleſs you can catch at the grace of God, without a plain particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. I ſay not, but there are Promiſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great, of this helping grace, and that Faith muſt build upon them, and doth: But I only mean, that the bare Revelation of the Treaſures of grace, that are with the Lord, ſhould, when an Intereſt in the Promiſes is dark, encourage a poor Soul to come for a ſhare of this grace of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4. <hi>But there is forgiveneſs with thee.</hi> He ſaith not, <hi>there is forgiveneſs for me,</hi> but <hi>there is forgiveneſs with thee.</hi> So ver. 7. <hi>Let Iſrael hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.</hi> Wherefore is this <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:93776:124"/> this <hi>mercy,</hi> this <hi>redemption</hi> with the Lord? and why is it revealed? but that the <hi>guilty</hi> ſhould come for this <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable</hi> for this <hi>mercy,</hi> the <hi>many-wiſe Captives</hi> for this <hi>plenteous redemption?</hi> The Lord's ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace, is an Argument for our Faith, as well as his Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs in making and performing Promiſes of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But we have <hi>Promiſes</hi> alſo for our Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. Promiſes <hi>imply God's fulneſs of grace,</hi> but do expreſs his <hi>Good will to diſpenſe it,</hi> and <hi>do bind and engage his Truth to fulfil them</hi> to all that take God at his Word, and truſt him on his Word. It is a pity that ever the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious Promiſes,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1,4. and <hi>precious Faith</hi> ſhould be parted. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.49. <hi>And Jeſus ſtood ſtill, and commanded him to be called; and they call the blind man, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, be of good comfort, riſe, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thee.</hi> They had no Promiſe, but they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s calling of the blind Man, was an Act of mercy, and on a deſign of ſhewing more mercy. But we have many Promiſes of grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have <hi>all the experience of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of his grace according to his Promiſes, for our encouragement in coming for grace.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Supplicant for grace, ſhould encourage his Heart, by all the Lord's diſpenſings of his grace. How many of theſe are reyealed in the Word? and many like them daily are to be ſeen in the <hi>Church of Christ.</hi> If you have ſuch Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of your own, build upon them, praiſe for them, and beg more. If you have none of your own, behold the Showers of Grace that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:93776:124"/> have fallen upon many as bad as your ſelves, and which have changed them into that ſame bleſſed State, that you deſire to be in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appl.</hi> 1. Is the grace of God thus helpful? and ſhould we come to the throne of grace for the help of grace? Then, we ſee that <hi>weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould pray moſt:</hi> Such as can do leaſt for themſelves, have moſt need of grace to help them, and ſhould ſeek it moſt. Is any Man under a clear Conviction, by the light of the Word, and his own ſenſible Experience, that he is extreamly weak, and utterly unable for any good Word or Work? This Man, of all Men, ſhould pray moſt. Manage your ſenſe of weakneſs, as a Call to ask much of this helping grace of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Surely then, <hi>Coming to the throne of grate for grace to help, muſt be hopeful work.</hi> If at any time, Satan, or an ungodly World, ſhould tempt you, or your own Heart fail you, in fears of the unprofitableneſs of ſeeking God, have this as a ready anſwer, <hi>I am fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; his grace can help me in every thing; whither ſhould I go but to a throne by grace? what can I beg there but his grace?</hi> Say with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 57.2,3. <hi>I will cry unto God moſt high; unto God that performeth all things for me. He ſhall ſend from Heaven and ſave me: God ſhall ſend forth his mercy and his Trath.</hi> And will not theſe ſave any Man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> I would give you a few directions in the practice of this Duty of coming to the throne of grace for helping grace. 1. Come to <hi>ſeek</hi> this helping grace. 2. When you ſeek
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:93776:125"/> it, <hi>expect</hi> it. 3. When you expect it, <hi>receave</hi> it. 4. When you receave it, <hi>guide</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Come to the throne of grace <hi>to ſeek help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace. Seeking</hi> (as is already remarked) is not expreſſed in the Text; yet it is plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed both in the Duty of <hi>Coming,</hi> and in the Bleſſings of <hi>obtaining</hi> and <hi>finding.</hi> You muſt ſeek grace to help you. Grace will not help to Sin, but helps againſt it, yet, bleſſed be God, grace can and will help ſinners, otherwiſe we were in a forlorn ſtate indeed. Grace will not help to lazineſs (that were an hinderance and no help) but grace will help lazy people, and help them out of it. To engage your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in ſeeking helping grace, I would ſhew you what <hi>help</hi> grace gives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Grace <hi>helps to ſave you.</hi> If people come to the throne of grace, if Men pray, and have not Salvation in their Eye, they come not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, they pray not. <hi>We are ſaved by grace,</hi> Eph. 2.5. Nothing but grace can ſave a ſinner; and if it were not the grace of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Omnipotent, it could not ſave. Is not it a great help, to be helped to Salvation? Is not that a great lift, <hi>to be delivered from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkneſs, and to be tranſlated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son?</hi> Col. 1.13. Who would not prize and deſire a ſaving lift of God's grace? All that have found it, value it; and they that never found it, ſhould (but will not) beg it earneſtly. <hi>The grace of God brings Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Tit. 2.11. It brings it near to Men in the Goſpel: This is all that it doth to many. But to ſome, this grace brings Salvation, and gives it, plants it in their Hearts, and waters
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:93776:125"/> it, and makes it grow with the increaſes of God, till it be ripe, full-grown Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Would you be helped to Heaven? Imploy amd implore the grace of God; it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can do it. And muſt not they periſh, and do they not periſh juſtly, that will not accept of ſaving grace? nor beg it, when they muſt periſh without it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace helps to <hi>grace.</hi> All the grace that is given to us, is but a drop from the great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of grace, that we make our Application to. The <hi>firſt grace</hi> that is in us, is a Gift and Stream of that grace that is with him. That gracious change that is wrought on a Sinner, by which of a <hi>graceleſs,</hi> he is made a <hi>graoious</hi> Perſon, How do you think it is brought about? There is a myſtery in it, that a Maſter in <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not know. <hi>John</hi> 3.9,10. No Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude from the old Creation, can fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it: yet ſome of them are uſed in the Word, and give ſome light. This Work of Grace on the Ungodly, whom this Grace falls on, is like <hi>a Sun-beam darted from the body of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, upon a Sinner dead in Sins, that doth immediately quicken him, and enliven him.</hi> It is both Light and Life. It is all originally in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and out of his fulneſs given to all that partake of it. <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</hi> Joh 8.12. <hi>I am the light of the world, he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of Life,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Lord Jeſus. Chriſt</hi> is ſuch a Sun, that all on whom his gracious Beams light, are ſaved: he quickens all he ſhines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Men periſh under the Goſpel indeed, but
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:93776:126"/> it is becauſe the Light of it ſhines only about them, and without them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4,6. but not into their Hearts. All the grace whereby any, and all the redeemed of the Lord are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beautified and ſaved, is from the higheſt Spring, grace in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with faith and love which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> How came <hi>Paul</hi> by all the Faith and Love his bleſſed Soul was filled with? All came from the grace of the Lord <hi>Jeſus?</hi> And every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of true grace, will own the ſame Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This helping grace which we ſhould ask, not only helps to Salvation and Grace, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>helps grace it ſelf.</hi> The grace receaved, muſt be refreſhed and watered and made to grow, by influences from the ſame Fountain, from whence it firſt flowed, or elſe it will wither quickly. Therefore we have the grace of God in the Fountain, to betake our ſelves unto, for the helping of his grace in us: For tho' grace <hi>as in Chriſt,</hi> needs no help, yet <hi>his grace given to,</hi> and <hi>dwelling in us,</hi> needs a great deal. The Father of the <hi>Lunatick,</hi> Mark 9.22,24. came to throne of grace but ſorrily: What a marvellous change was wrought in him, and that ſuddenly? In his firſt Addreſs he acted Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief groſly: in the next he acts Faith, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Faith, and prays <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s help againſt his Unbelief. Many did caſt out Devils in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Name, but none could help other folks Unbelief, nor their own. His begging help againſt his Unbelief, was the ſame Prayer with that of the Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5. <hi>Lord, increaſe our faith.</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:93776:126"/> And it gave more Honour to <hi>Christ</hi> in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Saviour, and did ſignifie more, both of true Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of an honeſt heart in the Man, than if he had addreſſed with the higheſt Confidence, to the Lord, <hi>to caſt the Devil out of his Son.</hi> The Youth is lying wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and foaming, and torn by the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the ſight of his tender Father: Yet no ſooner doth the <hi>light of Faith</hi> ſhine in his Heart, but he ſeeth a <hi>Devil of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> there alſo, and he firſt begs that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would caſt out that, and help his Faith; for <hi>helping of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> and <hi>helping of Faith</hi> is the ſame thing. He that ſeeks the <hi>helping of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> ſeeks the <hi>removing of it;</hi> and he that ſeeks the <hi>helping of hie Faith,</hi> ſeeks the <hi>increaſe and ſtrengthening of it.</hi> And both are done by the ſame Hand, by the ſame Act of Grace, and at the ſame time, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and where-ever they are done. And as it is with Faith, ſo is it with all the graces of the Spirit in Believers, they do need help of his grace: And it muſt be ſought at the throne of grace. Can you ſay, <hi>I repent?</hi> add, <hi>Lord help my Impenitence? I love,</hi> ſay, <hi>Lord help its cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and blow it up to a flame?</hi> Where the true grace of God is, there is ſtill ſome ſenſe of its weakneſs, and inclination after an encreaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſome dependance acted on the Lord, <hi>who began the good work, for performing it to the day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The grace of God helps <hi>our Infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8.26. If it were not written, we ſhould think it hard to uſe the expreſſion. If the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God plant grace in the Heart, is not that fair? if he water his own Plants, is not that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:93776:127"/> fair? Nay, but ſaith the Apoſtle, he <hi>helps our Infirmities alſo.</hi> Might not the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to have any dealing with the Infirmities of his People? Yes: but he will not. If he take no care of our Infirmities, we may and muſt be loſt thereby. A <hi>Criminal</hi> pardoned by an Act of Grace, may die of a Diſeaſe, if not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; may ſtarve of hunger and cold, if not provided with neceſſaries; may be ſlain by his Enemies, if not protected. Senſe of Infirmities, ſhould make us beg helping Grace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Grace helps <hi>in all the Work and Duty we are called to.</hi> Without aſſiſting grace, the leaſt piece of Work cannot be rightly done, and by its help any Work may be done. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. <hi>God is able to make all grace abound towards you, that ye always having all ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.</hi> There is <hi>Grace, all grace,</hi> and <hi>its abounding</hi> in God <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his people:</hi> From this given to them, there is <hi>ſufficiency,</hi> and <hi>all ſufficiency,</hi> and that <hi>always,</hi> and in <hi>all things,</hi> and thence flows <hi>good work, every good work,</hi> and <hi>abounding to every good work.</hi> Like to this is his Prayer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.21. <hi>The God of peace make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We need Grace's help in every good Work; no Work is truly good, but what grace helps us to. <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> agree ſweetly in this Order. <hi>Grace begins</hi> and <hi>Works follow.</hi> Grace works on the Man, and makes him a Worker: Grace paſſeth on the Perſon and his Works, and makes them accepted; and the accepted
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93776:127"/> Worker gives grace all the glory both of his Works, and of his own and their Acceptance. Whence his help comes, thither his Praiſes go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly.</hi> Grace helps in <hi>Extremities.</hi> But of this in the laſt thing in the Text.</p>
               <p>This then is the firſt Exhortation, Come to the throne of grace, <hi>ſeeking helping grace.</hi> Enlarge and heighten the ſenſe of your Need and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as much as you will, the Supply to be had at the Throne of grace is ſufficient. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your need accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his riches in glory, by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Stile, <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> change Names frequently, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6,12,14. and 3.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 2. You muſt not only ſeek grace to help, but when you ſeek it, you <hi>must expect it.</hi> The Text runs plainly this way. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle implies asking, but expreſſeth <hi>finding,</hi> and <hi>coming</hi> that we may <hi>find:</hi> therefore we ſhould <hi>come with expectation of finding.</hi> The Spirit and Life of Prayer in Faith, lyeth more in <hi>Expectation,</hi> then in <hi>asking.</hi> Unwiſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians let out the Life-Blood, and vital Spirits of Prayer, when they let their Expectations languiſh. Here is a common, but unregarded Error, in Chriſtians exerciſe. When they ſet their Face to pray, they make ſome Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſearching out their Wants, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to improve that ſight to the raiſing of fervent deſires of a ſupply of them; if they yet go higher to take in a ſenſe of the fulneſs and freeneſs of that grace where their help is; yet
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93776:128"/> how rarely are they careful to raiſe up Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of that helping grace? few can ſay as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.16. <hi>As for me, I will call upon God: and the Lord ſhall ſave me. ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Evening and morning, and at noon, will I pray and cry aloud, and he ſhall hear my voice,</hi> Few can charge their Souls as he did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.5. <hi>My Soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.</hi> See how the Prophet's Faith roſe, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.7. <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my Salvation: my God will hear me. Looking</hi> is a needy Act of Faith, <hi>wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is an expecting Act, and <hi>aſſurance</hi> is the higheſt. If you look to the Lord, you may quickly know he is the God of your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if you know him as the God of your Salvation, and your God, you will ask earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wait patiently, and by the ſame Faith Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy a gracious anſwer. What do you take Praying in Faith to be? <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6. It is not only to pray, believing that we call upon the true God, in the Name of Chriſt, and for things agreeable to his Will? it is not only that we believe that he is able to give what we ask, but that he will give what is good: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>his grace to help,</hi> is not only good, and always good, but nothing is good without it, <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould beg grace with confident Expectations. What means <hi>Christ's</hi> frequent anſwer to Men? <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.13. <hi>As thou haſt believed, ſo be it done unto thee,</hi> and <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.29. <hi>According to your Faith, be it unto you:</hi> Is it not to tell us, that he meaſures out his Bounty to Men, according to their believing Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from him? <hi>John</hi> 11.40. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93776:128"/> Martha, Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldeſt believe, thou ſhouldeſt ſee the glory of God?</hi> Our way is, if we could ſee the glory of God, then we would believe <hi>Chriſt's</hi> way is juſt contrary; we muſt firſt believe, and then we ſhall ſee the glory of God. We ſay, if the Lord would glorifie himſelf in performing his Promiſes, and in hearing our Prayers, then we would believe ſtrongly. But this is interverting of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Order. <hi>Martha</hi> was a Believer in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and expreſſeth Faith ſeveral ways in this Chapter. It appears in the joynt Meſſage they ſent to Chriſt, ver. 3. <hi>Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he whom thou loveſt, is ſick. ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Now Jeſus loved Martha, and her Siſter, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus.</hi> A bleſſed Family, and few like it, all <hi>loved of Chriſt,</hi> and doubtleſs-<hi>lovers of Christ:</hi> but they built more on his love to them, than on their love to him, like humble and wiſe Believers. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. <hi>Martha ſaid unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died.</hi> Her Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid the ſame, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. It is likely that none ever died in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Preſence, when he was on earth; he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all that imployed him. <hi>But I know that even now, whatſoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</hi> Here was ſome Faith. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſeth, ver. 23. <hi>that her brother ſhould riſe again,</hi> ſhe acts Faith as to the Doctrine of the Reſurrection ver. 24. <hi>I know that he ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection at the laſt day.</hi> When Chriſt goes on in preaching himſelf, ver. 25.26. and asks her of her Faith, ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red bravely, <hi>Yea, Lord, I believe that thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God, which ſhould come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93776:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> to the world, ver.</hi> 27. A Confeſſion like <hi>Peter</hi>'s, Matth. 16.16. What then was wanting in this good Woman? why doth our Lord put ſuch <hi>an if thou wouldeſt believe,</hi> to one that did believe ſo much and ſo well? Becauſe notwithſtanding her Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Perſon, as the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the <hi>Saviour of the world,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her Faith of his power, yet in this inſtance of raiſing <hi>Lazarus,</hi> ſhe expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. When <hi>Chriſt, ver.</hi> 39. bids <hi>take away the ſtone, ſhe ſaid, Lord, by this time he ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for he hath been dead four days.</hi> She that believed <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould riſe at the laſt day, could not believe that he ſhould riſe after death had held him but four days. Such is the very nature of Unbelief, or of weak Faith in true Believers; they can, or rather think they do, believe greater and harder things when not much tryed about them, better and more eaſily, than ſmaller and eaſier things that their Faith is called to a preſent exerciſe about. Let all Chriſtians in all their approaches to the throne of grace, behold this as written on the open Gates to this Throne, and hear it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by him that ſitteth on it, <hi>Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldeſt believe thou ſhouldeſt ſee the glory of God?</hi> Some Believers are apt to think, that a trembling fearing frame is fitter for them, and that raiſing of expectation of good from God, will prevent or hinder Humility, and lying low before the Lord. But they are quite miſtaken, that think <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> are inconſiſtent. They not only agree well together, but they cannot be
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:93776:129"/> parted. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Behold his Soul, which is lifted up, is not upright in him: But the juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> To bottom Expectations of grace from God, on the account of any good, real, or apprehended in us, or done by us, is not only deſtructive of Humility, but of Faith alſo. A <hi>Boaſter</hi> is an abominable Creature at the throne of grace; but a Pleader for, and Expectant of Grace for Grace's ſake is an humble Believer, and a right Courtier at this Throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 3. You muſt not only ſeek grace, when you come to the throne of grace, and expect it when you ſeek it, but you muſt be <hi>careful to receave grace when it is given.</hi> Make room for it. What is ſaid by the Lord in the Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10. though ſpoke in another caſe, is applicable to this: <hi>I will open you the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that there ſhall not be room enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave it.</hi> Felt Want, and ſtrong Faith, make much room for the grace of God. <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> Pſal: 81.10. It muſt be a wide-mouth'd Soul, that takes in, and a well-filled Soul that receaves a fill of God. How mighty is that Prayer? <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17,18,19. We have all need not only to get it by heart, but to get it into our Hearts, and to ſend it up to Heaven daily from our Hearts; <hi>Paul</hi> makes a ſpecial Preface to that Prayer, ver. 14, 15. In it he prays for <hi>the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the inner man, by the ſpirit,</hi> ver. 16. <hi>That Chriſt might dwell in their Hearts by Faith,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>That being rooted in love, they might meaſure the dimenſions of Chriſt's love, and know it that paſſeth knowledge,</hi> ver. 18, 19. Can any Man go higher in Prayer? Yes, one
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93776:130"/> ſtep higher; <hi>That ye might he filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> Now who hath room in his Soul for the anſwer of ſuch a Prayer as this is? If we had not theſe mighty Words in this way, we ſhould be tempted to think that it were rather a Prophecy of what is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed within the Vail, than a Prayer of Faith to be put up by Travellers in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and for, Bleſſings to be enjoyed in the Houſe of their Pilgrimage. But a Prayer it is, and ſome good performance is given within time, though the main meaſure of the anſwer of this (as of all the moſt ſpiritual Prayers of Saints in this liſe) is referved for the day of the Lord. It is a greater matter both of Duty and Dimculty, than moſt Chriſtians think, to have the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Doors of our Souls lifted up, and caſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that the King of Glory may enter with his ſuper-abounding grace. Many Believers take much pains, and make many Prayers, for that grace of God, which yet they teceave not, when it comes and craves room and admittance. Grace comes always in and with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore hinders his Welcome, excludes his Grace from entering. Grace comes in and by the <hi>Promiſe:</hi> If the Promiſe be not receaved by Faith, how can the Grace promiſed be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved: Grace comes always as <hi>Grace,</hi> free and undeſerved. How can a proud Perſon receave it? And there is Pride often working in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of Chriſtians: They find they want much of the helping grace of God, they ask it, they ſee it in the Promiſes, and in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s hand: But they think, ſhould ſuch as I, lay hold on ſuch a precious gift, as his grace? Why not? It is grace, grace offered of grace,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:93776:130"/> given of grace: Do you need it? Why do you not receave it, and make room for it? Some receave not that grace that is tendered to them, becauſe it is not the particular grace they ſought and expected, or becauſe it comes not to them in that way they looke for it in. Others receave not, nor welcome the grace they beg, becauſe they think they cannot receave it: They look on <hi>Receaving</hi> as a great and difficult buſineſs, far above their ability. But, is refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it, hard alſo? Alas! that is eaſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe natural to our Hearts. Is not the ſeed of Receaving, in all ſincere asking and expecting of grace from God? receaving of his grace is no more but a Heart-willingneſs that his grace may enter in, and act like it ſelf upon us: And this receaving act of Faith, doth greatly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God. Some think it very ſtrange, and hardly credible, that any Believer can ask earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly that grace, which when tendered, he is not willing to receave. See how it was with ſome eminent-Saints, <hi>Job</hi> 9.16. <hi>If I had called, and he had anſwered me, yet would not I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he had hearkened unto my voice.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>for he breaketh me with a tempest, ver.</hi> 17. But may not fatherly Love and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection be together on a Believer? <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. Yet the ſenſe of the ſmart of Correction, is a ſtrong Temptation to queſtion the Love of the Correcter. <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Pſal. 77.1,2. <hi>I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice, and he gave ear unto me.</hi> Who would think that this Man refuſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted? Did he not pray for Confolation. Yet he ſaith, <hi>My Soul refuſed to be comforted. I remembred God and was troubled. I complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:93776:131" rendition="simple:additions"/> and my Spirit was overwhelmed.</hi> There is a peeviſhneſs of Unbelief, that Chriſtians ſhould watch againſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Exhort.</hi> 4. You muſt take care to <hi>guide this helping grace of God, when you have receaved it.</hi> Guiding of grace is an Art and Myſtery that Chriſtians ſhould ſtudy diligently. The rule of this Art, is this, <hi>Guide the grace of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved by you, for thoſe ends for which it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by him.</hi> Now what ends hath the Lord in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his grace? They are only two. 1. For the <hi>Praiſe and Glory of the Giver.</hi> 2. For the <hi>Benefit of the Receavers.</hi> Guide his Grace for thoſe ends, and you guide and uſe it well. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have little of his Grace, and complain ſorrowfully; not becauſe he gives, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave little, but becauſe they guide and manage this richeſt Talent poorly. Dare any Believer forbear to ſay, if I had kept all I had got, and guided well all he hath given, I had been far richer in Grace, than now I am? Miſguiding of Grace receaved is the greateſt Sin, becauſe an abuſe of the greateſt Bleſſing. Watch againſt it, if you love his Glory, and your own Weal.</p>
               <p>I come now to the forth and laſt thing in the Verſe about this Grace of God, and that is, <hi>the Seaſonableneſs of its Help.</hi> It helps always, but eſpecially in <hi>time of need.</hi> On this I ſhall now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note ſome few things in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Whatever Believers preſent Caſe be, a time of need may come.</hi> And they ſhould fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee it. Though they know not particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, yet they ſhould lay their account with it. The Lord gives faithful Warnings in the Word, Faith ſhould take them. We ſee the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93776:131"/> times of need that many others come in; and we ſhould take warning by their Experience. Every Chriſtian hath found times of ſpecial need for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: the like may come again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Christians ſhould pray before the time of need come, for that grace that may help them when it comes.</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks of <hi>bearing for the time to come.</hi> Iſa. 42.23. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. of <hi>laying up in ſtore a good foundation for the time to come.</hi> So here, Men muſt pray for the time to come. <hi>Is any man afflicted? let him pray,</hi> Jam. 5.13. And becauſe any Man may be afflicted, he ſhould pray before-hand.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>we know not but we may be ſurprized by a time of need.</hi> Our Lord's Argument, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.33. <hi>Take ye heed, watch and pray, for ye know not when the time is.</hi> The Lord rarely gives particular warning of the time when ſpecial need is coming. It ordinarily comes by ſurprize to us. Death may, but Sickneſs, Loſſes, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction uſually come on ſuddenly: And <hi>ſurprizing Tryals</hi> are ſore and ſearching ones.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhould pray before a time of need come, for <hi>often when that time comes, we are thereby diſabled for Prayer.</hi> The diſtreſs may be ſuch, that even a Believer can do nothing. The <hi>night may come, when no man can work,</hi> John 9.4. Pray much before it come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe <hi>many Prayers have their anſwers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed till a time of need comes.</hi> Chriſtians think that every day and hour of their Life, is a time of need (and ſo it is in ſome ſenſe) but there are ſome ſpecial Seaſons of great need, of which the Lord is the only Diſpoſer; and he fits ſuch times with diſpenſings of that Grace, that his People
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:93776:132"/> have many a day begged before. There may be worſe reaſoning than this: <hi>It may be there are ſome Bleſſings of Grace, that I have oft ſought, and have not yet got, that are reſerved for me by the Lord, againſt a time, when I ſhall need them more than now I do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, in the Scope of the Apoſtle in theſe Words, that there is ſtrong arguing for conſtant ſeeking of God's Grace. You are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at preſent in a time of ſpecial need; or if it be not preſent, it may come. Whatever caſe a Believer is in, his Obligation is in a manner equal, to this great Duty, of <hi>coming to the Throne of Grace for Grace to help him,</hi> as his Matters do require.</p>

               <p>YOU have heard that the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exhortation in the Text to coming to the Throne of Grace, is directed with reſpect to the getting of two great Bleſſings, or of one under two Names, <hi>God's Mercy and Grace.</hi> Concerning this Grace I have ſpoken to 3 things. 1. What this <hi>Grace</hi> is. 2. What the <hi>finding of this Grace</hi> is. 3. What is the <hi>Helpfulneſs of this Grace ſo found,</hi> I alſo entered upon the fourth and laſt thing,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93776:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> the <hi>Seaſonableneſs</hi> of this helping Grace. The Truth I am to ſpeak to, is this: <hi>The Grace of God is ſpecially helpful in times of ſpecial need.</hi> My Work then is to ſhew. What are <hi>thoſe times of need.</hi> 2. What the <hi>helpfulneſs of grace</hi> in them is. Only I would uſher in this Diſcourſe, with a general Conſideration of the conſtant need that all ſtand in of God's Mercy and Grace. And that I would branch into four. We need God's Mercy and Grace, as <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> as <hi>Men,</hi> as <hi>Sinners,</hi> and as <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that always.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As <hi>Creatures.</hi> The native Notion of a Creature is, that it is a <hi>contingent, neceſſitous Being: For his pleaſure they are and were created,</hi> Rev. 4.11. The Lord did not make all or any Creature, becauſe he needed them, but he made them that they might need him. He did not build this glorious Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, as a <hi>Houſe to dwell in,</hi> or <hi>to contain him,</hi> 1 Kings 8.27. But he made this World as a <hi>Stage,</hi> on which to diſplay his glorious Wiſdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and he made ſome of its Inhabitants, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in the <hi>upper Rooms,</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> in the <hi>lower,</hi> to be Spectators, and Praiſers of his Glory. It is not proper to ſay, that Creatures needed their Being, before the Creator gave it. For when there was nothing but God, there could be no need. <hi>Need</hi> and <hi>Want</hi> is eſſential to a Creature, and ſprings up with their <hi>Being.</hi> As ſoon as the Creation receaved its Being by the <hi>word of his power,</hi> it needs <hi>upholding by the ſame power,</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>Our Lord Jeſus upholds all things by the word of his power.</hi> The whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would fall back immediately into its <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93776:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> Nothing,</hi> if the ſame power that gave it a Being, did not every moment preſerve it. Would you have a joyful view of Heaven and Earth? Look on all as in our Lord's Hand. Why do the Heavens keep their Courſe? Why doth the Sun ſhine ſo gloriouſly, move ſo regularly, and influence the Earth ſo virtuouſly with his light and heat? It is becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> upholds all things by the Word of his Power. <hi>He is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt: All things were created by him, and for him,</hi> Col. 1.16,17. <hi>Many are without Chriſt in the World. Eph.</hi> 2.12. Man ſee daily the Works of Creation and Providence, and never think on <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the Head of all. But it is no wonder, that Men that have no Eyes to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace,</hi> cannot ſee him in the <hi>old Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature.</hi> We, as Creatures, are needy of God's helping Grace and Favour; for <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our Being,</hi> Acts 17.28. <hi>In his hand our breath is, and his all our ways are,</hi> Dan. 5.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our need of God's Grace appears yet more, as we are ſuch Creatures, <hi>Men.</hi> We are, through the Bounty of God, the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of this lower Creation. Of <hi>Man,</hi> ſome underſtand that elegant Phraſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.26, <hi>the higheſt part of the Duſt of the world.</hi> But there is no earthly Creature needy of God's Grace but Man even in his natural Frame, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract from his ſinful State. The great Former of all things, hath given to all a <hi>Being,</hi> and to many of his Creatures no more: To ſome of his Creatures he hath given <hi>Life,</hi> a nobler ſort of Being. But to all living Creatures, but Man,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93776:134"/> he gives no more, and they need no more; they have not, they need not <hi>eternal life.</hi> When the Breath of the other living Creatures <hi>goes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> in the Word is <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.21. there is an end of them. But Man is created in that ſtate, that he muſt be for ever, and therefore be eternally happy or miſerable. This State, he is made in, makes him vaſtly needy of God's Grace and Mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We grow yet more needy, <hi>as Sinners.</hi> Sinners are Creatures, with this great blemiſh of <hi>Guilt, Sin,</hi> and <hi>Corruption.</hi> A Sinner is needy of a <hi>Mediator</hi> to deal for him with God; for he cannot deal with God for himſelf: A Sinner is needy of the <hi>Righteouſneſs of another</hi> to recommend him to God's Acceptance; for he hath none of his own. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of a Sinner</hi> is a plain Contradiction: And unleſs the power of Sin had blinded Men in the right knowledge of God and of themſelves, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it had puſſed up their Hearts in this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there had never been any pretence made by fallen Men to Self-Righteouſneſs; but now nothing is more common, more groundleſs, and yet more rooted in Mens Hearts, than that a Sinner, can, and may, if he will, bring or do ſomewhat, that may have ſome intereſt in, and influence on, his Acceptance with God. A Sinner is needy of a <hi>Right to eternal life;</hi> and this muſt be bought by another, for he can never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it for himſelf. He is needy of <hi>Safety from the Wrath to come,</hi> which is ſo wofully well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by him, and the Man can do nothing of himſelf, but what deſerves it, more and further.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:93776:134"/>
               <p n="4">4. We are needy of the help of Grace <hi>as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as new Creatures.</hi> A Chriſtian is a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> by nature, a <hi>humane Creature,</hi> a <hi>ſinful Creature,</hi> but made a <hi>new Creature</hi> by grace. Yet there are ſome ſprings of conſtant need of Grace, in this <hi>new Creature, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The neceſſary and conſtant dependance of the new Creature on its Fountain and Author, makes a Chriſtian to be a very needy Creature.</hi> The dependance of the Beams on the Sun, is not more neceſſary, than the dependance of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian on <hi>Chriſt. Without me</hi> (or ſeparate from me) <hi>ye can do nothing,</hi> John 15.5. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians life is by a continual Eflux from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and is to be ſought and maintained by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant dependance on him; as Light is from the Sun. Never was there, nor can there be, a Room ſo full of Light from the Sun-beams, but if either the Sun withdraw his Light, or if you exclude its light by cloſing Doors and Windows, it immediately becomes dark, and that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. It is ſo with all Chriſtians. If it were not that the <hi>new Covenant</hi> hath aſſured us, that there ſhall be no final and total ſeparating of the Fountain from the Stream, there would ſoon be an expiring of all that Good, that is in the beſt of Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Chriſtian is always a needy Creature, becauſe he <hi>hath much work to do, and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Work, and all above his ſtrength.</hi> He that bath moſt Work, and leaſt Strength, is moſt needy of help. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12,13. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you, both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o will and to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93776:135"/> do of his good pleaſure.</hi> If the Exhortation or Command had been without the Argument, it had been diſcouraging. What can a Man do about his own Salvation? <hi>It is God that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a good work in them, and will perform it till the day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6. Put hand to your Work, for help is near. As the Exhortation, <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> hath the height of Duty in it: So the Argument <hi>for it is God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> doth deeply debaſe Man's Sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and highly advance both the Sovereignty, and Efficacy of his aſſiſting Grace. And hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that Chriſtian, who can lay the weight of the Command on his Conſcience, and can at the ſame time improve the Encouragement for believing obeying. Whoever is void of a ſenſe of his need of God's aſſiſting Grace, looks not rightly on the great Work lying before him, and ſeeth not the great weakneſs that is in him. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing, as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In this great work above his ſtrength, the Chriſtian <hi>meets with much Oppoſition, both from within, and from without:</hi> Not always in the ſame meaſure; but ſome always. Special mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of oppoſition, make times of ſpecial need, of which I ſhall ſpeak. But there is ſomewhat of oppoſition that is conſtant. <hi>Gal,</hi> 5.17. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh: and theſe are contrary the one to the other; ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</hi> This <hi>Fleſh</hi> and this <hi>Spirit</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:93776:135"/> is in all Chriſtians: if a Man were all <hi>Fleſh,</hi> he were no Chriſtian; if he were all <hi>Spirit,</hi> he would be perfect, as the Saints glorified be. This <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit, luſt</hi> and <hi>ſtrive</hi> on againſt the other: And ſo they muſt do, for they <hi>are contrary one to the other</hi> The effect of this <hi>luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and contrariety is, that <hi>the Chriſtian cannot do the things that he would.</hi> He cannot do all the <hi>Fleſh</hi> luſts to, becauſe of the <hi>Spirit's</hi> oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he cannot do all the <hi>Spirit</hi> luſts after, becauſe of the oppoſition of the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> Of this Combate the Apoſtle ſpeaks largely from his own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. And the more oppoſition a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian meets with, (and I have named but one Head of it) the more needy is he of helping Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Chriſtians <hi>State of abſence from the Lord, renders him a needy Creature.</hi> He is made for the Lord, fram'd ſo, that, as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, nothing ſhort of being for ever and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately with the Lord, reigns in his Heart, as his Prize and Mark. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2,4. <hi>In this we groan earneſtly, deſining to be cloathed with our Houſe, which is from Heaven. We that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened; not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life.</hi> What ails a Believer to groan ſo oft and ſo deeply? It is to be in Heaven with the Lord. And the more heavenly and holy a Chriſtian be, the more frequent and earneſt are theſe groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. He hath the moſt healthy Soul, who is ſick of Love, whoſe Heart is ſick with deſires of being preſent with the Lord. The Believer that is moſt aſſured of Heaven, groans deepeſt. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers run on in Sin, and ſing to Hell, while Hell
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93776:136"/> groans for them; and ſad will the meeting be. We find <hi>Paul</hi> groaning for himſelf, only for two things, The <hi>body of ſin and death, its dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him,</hi> Rom. 7.24. and his <hi>dwelling in the body.</hi> We do not, nor can we know the vaſt difference that is betwixt the happy State of the Saints in Heaven, and the beſt State of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers on Earth: We do but gueſs in the dark, and our gueſſes are but Negative; that they are removed from all the Evils we find here: No Sin, no Clouds, no Death, no Crying, or any thing to complain of. But theſe <hi>Negatives</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in by Faith and Experience, with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte, and firſt fruits of that good Land, make Believers groan to be poſſeſſed of it, though they go as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. <hi>not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither.</hi> Heaven will be a bleſſed ſurprize to all the Poſſeſſors of it: They will find it a far better State, than their higheſt thoughts and largeſt deſires could point forth.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe Spirings of conſtant need, there are ſpecial Seaſons of Chriſtians need of God's Grace. And they are eaſily known by this general Rule; <hi>That time that comes on a Believer, wherein he is in great and ſpecial dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, from which only preſent ſupplies of grace, can preſerve him,</hi> that is a ſeaſon of ſpecial need of Grace, and in the proſpect of, or in ſuch Seaſons, Chriſtians ſhould ply the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch times of Need, I would ſpeak to ſix of them. 1. The time of <hi>Temptation.</hi> 2. Of a <hi>Spiritual decay.</hi> 3. Of <hi>High Enjoyments and Attainments.</hi> 4. Of <hi>Affliction.</hi> 5. Of <hi>Special Duty and Service.</hi> 6. <hi>Of Dying.</hi> Theſe are all
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93776:136"/> Seaſons and Times of ſpecial need of God's Grace. And how ſuch render Chriſtians <hi>needy of Grace,</hi> and how <hi>helpful his Grace is in ſuch Times,</hi> is all I mind to ſay on this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Times of need, is <hi>the time of Temptation. An hour of Temptation,</hi> Rev. 3.10. <hi>A time of Temptation,</hi> Luke 8.13. <hi>A day of Temptation,</hi> Pſal. 95.8. But becauſe Temptation is of large ſignification, and of ſundry ſorts, and from various Quarters, I ſhall confine my ſelf to that ſort that is from Satan: And on this Head would confine my ſelf to theſe three. 1. What <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation</hi> is. 2. What <hi>need of Grace to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted.</hi> 3. <hi>How Grace helps in time of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. What is <hi>Temptation.</hi> As we are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, three things are in a Temptation. An <hi>outward Object,</hi> the occaſion; <hi>inward Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that is as fuel for the Temptation; and <hi>Satan's motion to ſin,</hi> and his working on theſe two, to hatch Sin. He is but twice called the <hi>Tempter:</hi> firſt when he came to <hi>Chriſt, Matth.</hi> 4.3. And again, when he comes to Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.5. Theſe three are not neceſſarily in all Temptations. In his tempting the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> there was only an <hi>outward Object,</hi> and a <hi>Motion of Satan.</hi> But in all Men beſides, theſe three are in all Temptations: And the Spirit of God in the Word gives the name of Temptation to all of them. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptation.</hi> Few either of the poor or of the rich, believe this. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14,15. <hi>Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93776:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> Then when luſt hath conceaved, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth Sin; and Sin, when it is finiſhed, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth, death.</hi> Hence the difficulty is great in diſcovering <hi>Satan</hi>'s hand in tempting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is inward Corruption in Men, that acts and works of it ſelf, as well, as it is fit to be acted upon by <hi>Satan.</hi> If Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Satan</hi> came to a ſinleſs Man, the Tempter might be eaſily known; but when it comes to a ſinner, who hath an active Principle of Corruption in him, that prompts him to the fame ſin, that the Tempter tempts unto, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes very hard to a Man to ſay, <hi>This motion is of the Devil,</hi> and <hi>this is of my own corrupt heart.</hi> And here ſeldom doth the Devil get his due; ſome blame the Devil more than he deſerves, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves more than they ſhould: And ſome excuſe the Devil, and blame themſelves more than they ought. What ſhall we do here? How ſhall we know when Temptation riſeth from Corruption within, or from the Devil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? There is no very great need to know it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, as in ſome Caſes it is very hard to know it. Temptation is ſo natural to us, that if the Devil be the firſt Mover, it ſeizeth ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on our corrupt Heart, that we may juſtly take the blame, to our ſelves. The Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> on the <hi>new creature,</hi> and of the Spirit of <hi>Satan</hi> on the old Man, are great Myſteries. It is far wiſer work to ſet about reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ing of our ſpiritual Enemies, than to perplex out ſelves with Queſtions about their Order. Therefore.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:93776:137"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What need is there of the grace of God to help the tempted.</hi> This is plain. Every one that is in this Caſe, knows his great need of grace. Yet to make them that are not in it, pity them that are; and to direct them that are in it, to entertain a deeper ſenſe of their need of God's grace, I would ſhow how needy a Perſon under Temptation, is of the helping grace of God. This appears in theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt commands us to pray againſt Temptation.</hi> He doth not ſo command us, to pray againſt Affliction. In that Pattern of Prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9,13. (the Words where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are better known, than the deep ſenſe and meaning of the Words is underſtood) there are but two Petitions for ſpiritual Bleſſings for our ſelves; one is, for the <hi>pardon of ſin,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the State of our Perſons; the other is, for <hi>Sanctification and Preſervation;</hi> and that is expreſſed thus, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation.</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is prayed for, in praying againſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation: And much of Sanctification is acted in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch a Prayer. But may not a Man enter into Temptation, and come well out of it again? Yes. But in that caſe, more thanks is due to the Lord's grace and mercy, than to his own good Conduct. <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have you to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Temptation, and to pray againſt it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41. <hi>Watch and pray that ye enter not into Temptation.</hi> Whatever Temptation a man ruſheth confidently upon, he uſually falls by. In Temptation, no Believer is ſafe, but the ſelf-diffident and fearful; and fear of Temptation, acts in praying againſt it. <hi>Peter</hi> failed in his fearleſneſs; his going to the <hi>High-prieſts Hall,</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:93776:138"/> after the warning his Maſter gave him, was ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a Temptation; and ſo came on it. It muſt therefore be a Caſe wherein one is very needy of grace to help, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids us pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We find the <hi>whole Armour of God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and prepared on purpoſe for the caſe of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Eph. 6.10,13. The Apoſtle is ſounding the Alarm of War to all Chriſtians; he ſhews them where their ſtrength lyes. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</hi> He ſhews them their Weapons of War. <hi>v.</hi> 10, to <hi>v.</hi> 19. and tells them how to uſe them. Their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is that of <hi>God.</hi> No Armour but that that is from Heaven, is proof againſt the Batteries and Aſſaults of Hell: How doth the Devil laugh at, deſpiſe, and pierce thorough that Soul, whoſe Armour is forged and framed on Earth? This Armour of God, the Chriſtian <hi>muſt put on,</hi> and <hi>take to himſelf;</hi> it's not enough that he know it, and have it lying by him; it is no Armour to him, till it be put on by him. And why ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſo put on? <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Becauſe of ſuch dreadful Enemies as we have to deal with: <hi>For we wreſtle not against fleſh and blood</hi> (Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies formidable and dangerous ſufficiently, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that have no more but <hi>fleſh and blood</hi> to oppoſe them with) <hi>but againſt principalities, againſt powers, against the rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places.</hi> What but the whole Armour of God, can ſecure a poor Believer from all the Armies of Hell?</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:93776:138"/>
               <p n="3">3. Our bleſſed Lord <hi>Jeſus himſelf was tempted, that he might ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> Heb. 2.18. There are ſeveral States and Conditions that Believers are in, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf was never in. We are oft ſick and weak in Body; <hi>Chriſt</hi> was always in ſound and perfect Health of Body: For Sickneſs is a conſequent of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sin and Corruption of Nature; and of that, <hi>Chriſt</hi> had none. Many particular Diſtreſſes we meet with and wreſtle with, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew not by his own Experience. But this ſad caſe of Temptation, he knew and felt. But ye may ſay, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had never been tempted, had he not been able to ſuccour them that are tempted? Yes: no doubt; for no bounds can be ſet to his Divine Power, as God. What then doth his Experience of Temptation ſignifie to the Succour of the tempted Believer? It is the <hi>Ground of his Sympathy with them,</hi> and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy draws forth his helping Grace: It is a ground <hi>for the Faith of the Tempted,</hi> to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How ſweet is this thought to a Chriſtian thus exerciſed? <hi>I am indeed a tempted Believer, but I have a Saviour that was tempted himſelf, and remembers it ſtill, and pities them, and will help them that are in that caſe, that was once ſo grievous to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. A Tempted Perſon is needy of God's help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, becauſe <hi>Sin came in at firſt by Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation.</hi> Temptation was the Door that ſin came in by, and entered into the world of Mankind. How ſin came in upon the Angels that fell, is deeper than that we can know it. And it is no great matter for us to be ignorant of it. We know they are now the worſt, and moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93776:139"/> and moſt miſerable of all the Creatures; and that originally they were of the moſt eminent Order; as one well ſaid, <hi>The Lord wiſely would not declare the nature of that Diſeaſe, he was reſolved never to cure.</hi> And ſo we muſt leave it in the dark. But as to Sins coming into the World of Mankind, we have more light. The Lord created the root of Mankind upright and perfect, firſt the <hi>Man,</hi> then the <hi>Woman;</hi> in their created State, there was no ſin in either of them. But Temptation was ſo applyed by Satan, that it quickly begot ſin. This Argument the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle uſeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>I fear leſt by any means, as the ſerpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city that is in Chriſt.</hi> If Satan did prevail to bring in ſin by Temptation upon the ſinleſs and perfect; what may he not do on ſinners, in whom he hath ſo much Intereſt, and over whom he hath ſo great advantage, by ſomewhat of his own in them?</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is great need of the Grace of God in a time of Temptation, becauſe of <hi>the frequent ſad Effects of Temptation,</hi> unleſs preſent help of Grace be given. Rarely doth a Temtation and our Hearts meet, but ſome fire of ſin is kindled. I would name a few of thoſe Effects of Temptation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Temptation <hi>doth often diſcover hid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen evil, and brings it to light.</hi> It brings forth that, which the Perſon before the Temptation, never thought was in him. So it is with the Ungodly, and the Godly themſelves. When <hi>Hazael</hi> was told by the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> what miſchief he would do to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſaid, 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:93776:139"/> 8.13. <hi>But what, is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do this great thing? But,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eliſha, the Lord hath ſhewed me that thou ſhalt be King over Syria.</hi> Then thou wilt have Power, and Will to do it. <hi>What wickedneſs will not that Man do, whom Satan-tempts, and whom God leaves? Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> fell dreadfully by Temptation: And <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah.</hi> 2 Chron. 32.31. <hi>Howbeit, in the buſineſs of the Embaſſadors of the Princes of Babylon, who ſent unto him, to enquire of the wonder that was done in the Land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.</hi> When the Veſſel is broach'd by a convenient Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, that Liquor will come out, that was never thought to be within. When <hi>Herod</hi> feared <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>obſerved,</hi> or <hi>preſerved</hi> him, <hi>when on his hearing him, he did many things, and heard him gladly,</hi> who would have thought he would have beheaded him? <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20,21. But a <hi>convenient day came;</hi> a day when <hi>Herod</hi> lay fair for Temptation, and a day that <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>Herodias,</hi> and <hi>her Daughter,</hi> his Servants, laid the Temptation before him, then the poor wretch was ſoon overcome. But indeed, it was more ſtrange, that ſuch a King as <hi>Herod,</hi> ſhould hear ſuch a Prophet as <hi>John. Baptiſt</hi> preach, than that he ſhould murder him. At leaſt it is, and hath been far more uſual to bad Kings, to <hi>ſlay Prophets,</hi> than to <hi>hear them glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Peter</hi> was ſo confident in his Courage, that, in a manner (tho' againſt both Grace and good Manners) he gives the Lie to his Maſter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.31,35. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus to them, All ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night, ver.</hi> 33. <hi>Peter anſwered and ſaid unto him, Though
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93776:140"/> all men ſhould be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never be offended. As</hi> if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, at least, except me out of this All thou ſpeaks of.</hi> Becauſe he would not take the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Warning, <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives him a particular one. <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, Verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi> Will not <hi>Peter</hi> believe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaking ſo peremptorily and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? <hi>No. ver.</hi> 35. <hi>Peter ſaid unto him, though I ſhould die with thee</hi> (<hi>or for thy ſake,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 13.37.) <hi>yet will I not deny thee. Likewiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaid all the Diſciples.</hi> So loath and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward are, even Godly Men, to own that to be in them, that they do not ſee and feel at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent working in them. Theſe Words, <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt ſpoke (bating that awful fear that ſhould have ſeized on them, from ſuch a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Christ</hi> gave them) were Words of Duty, and were doubtleſs the honeſt Expreſſions of their preſent thoughts. Yet when the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came, <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Warning took place, and their <hi>Reſolutions</hi> vaniſhed like Smoak. They all forſook him and fled; <hi>Peter</hi> followed afterward, and denyed him ſhamefully. The Voice of a Damſel overthrew this Man, that had Courage to draw his Sword in his Maſters defence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt armed Men. <hi>John</hi> 18. He denyed he knew his dear Maſter, when, if he had own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and himſelf as his Servant, there was no danger. <hi>John</hi> was there, and at the Croſs too, without any harm.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Temptation often <hi>brings on a great and fudden damp and eclipſe on the work of God's Grace in the heart.</hi> It is as the Smoak of Hell
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:93776:140"/> in the Soul, that darkens the Room; ſo that is Believer cannot ſee what of God is in him. It is, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls it, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31. <hi>A ſifting a man as wheat. Wheat,</hi> and <hi>Chaff,</hi> and <hi>Dust</hi> are then mingled together. No Believer in this caſe, can give ſuch a clear and diſtinct Account, nor have ſo plain a diſcovery of God's Work in him, as before and after the Temptation. Chriſtians give the Devil the advantage he ſeeks, when they judge of themſelves and their State, in the fit of a Temptation. <hi>Act Grace diligently</hi> when in <hi>Temptation,</hi> and <hi>try your State</hi> as carefully as you can, when you are out of <hi>Temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Temptation <hi>increaſeth greatly and ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeen and known Corruption.</hi> If Temptation come on a latent hid Corruption, it may bring it forth: but if it come on a known Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it was not ſo powerful before, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation will make it rage. The Temptation came on <hi>Judas:</hi> For as hateful as his name is juſtly to all Chriſtians, yet before he fell, no Man ſuſpected him, only <hi>Chriſt knew him.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave the Warning, <hi>John</hi> 13.21. That <hi>one of the twelve ſhould betray him:</hi> All the <hi>eleven</hi> ſaid, <hi>Is it I?</hi> and at laſt the <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> ſaid ſo, and was anſwered. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.21,25. The luſt the Devil acted on, was his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs:</hi> He was a Thief, a lover of Money, and the Devil put him at laſt upon a Bargain, that was his Ruin. For a Servant to betray his Maſter, and ſuch a Maſter; for a ſinnen to ſell the Saviour of all ſinners that are ſaved, for ſo inconſiderable a Summ, after ſo fair a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Sin and Ruin by it, was a proof of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:93776:141"/> the mighty power of Temptation over a Man. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> chargeth <hi>Ananias</hi> thus, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> The filling of his Heart was <hi>Satan</hi>'s Work, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; Why then doth he ask the Man an account of, or charge him with <hi>Satan</hi>'s Action? Becauſe the <hi>Devil</hi> can fill no Man's Heart with a ſinful purpoſe, till the Man give way to, and comply with the <hi>Devils</hi> working.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>What is that help that Grace gives to the Tempted.</hi> We have heard how Temptation renders a Man needy of Grace, now let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how this Grace can, and doth help in this Caſe. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Temptation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7,8,9. betakes himſelf to the right courſe, to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Lord: And <hi>thrice he beſought the Lord that it might depart from him.</hi> He is anſwered, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> We would be apt to think, that <hi>Paul</hi>'s great ſtock of Grace, and manifold Experience, and his late extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Enjoyment, might have been ſufficient to have ſupported <hi>Paul</hi> in his Conflict. No; they could not: Our Lord ſaith not, Thy Grace is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for thee, which I have abundantly beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on thee: <hi>But my grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> So the ſame Apoſtle exhorts another. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Be ſtrong in the grace that is in Christ Jeſus</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. There are many Enemies of the Grace of God, becauſe few are Partakers of it. Such as have not felt the Power of it on their own Hearts, will alway pick quarrels with the pure Doctrine of Grace. Some can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receave this plain Goſpel-Truth, that a Man muſt be conſtituted Righteous in the ſight of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:93776:141"/> God, only through the Righteouſneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon, even <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> imputed to the ſinner of Free-grace. And ſome that own this Truth, ſtumble again on this other Truth, that the Sanctification of a juſtined Believer, flows from the conſtant Supplies of Grace from <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Head and Root. They think that there are Habits of Grace implanted in the new Creature (and this is not to be denyed) and if they guide well what they have received in the Grace of Regeneration, they may live well, and grow on to Perfection. But it is not duly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Men's ſpiritual Exerciſe, that no Stock of Grace was ever given to any Believer, to take him off the Senſe of his need of daily depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the original Grace in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> But the greateſt Receavers, always act their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance moſt humbly, and ſee their need of it moſt clearly, and find the benefit of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance moſt comfortably. Obſerve alſo our Lord's Argument for the Encouragement of <hi>Paul; For my strength is made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> What is <hi>Chriſt's Grace</hi> in the Anſwer, is <hi>Chriſt's ſtrength</hi> in this Argument. What is <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency</hi> in the one, is <hi>making perfect</hi> in the other. As if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had ſaid to <hi>Paul, I ſee the Devil is too hard for thy weakneſs, but thy weakneſs, ſupported by my ſtrength, ſhall be too hard for Satan.</hi> Now ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> improves this anſwer: <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my Infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may rest upon me.</hi> No wonder <hi>he glory in Chriſt,</hi> and in <hi>Chriſt's Grace</hi> beſtowed on him, for that any Chriſtian can do, but this <hi>glorying in Infirmities,</hi> is an exerciſe of Grace, only found with ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:93776:142"/> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> was. Who is not humbled, and afraid of his Infirmities? Here is a Believer that glories in them; but why? and how? <hi>that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</hi> Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as <hi>Infirmities,</hi> have nothing in them to excite glorying: But Infirmities, as <hi>Opportunities</hi> for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of the Glory of <hi>Chriſt's Grace</hi> in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under them, are to be gloried in. <hi>Chriſt</hi> acts on them, and the ſenſible Believer imploys him therein: Our Weakneſs is the Field, his Strength is glorified in. Whoever doth not own his Infirmities, forfeits the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Grace of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Grace that helps in Temptation, is <hi>Chriſt's Grace,</hi> the imploying of him for it, and drawing it from him, is by Faith, and ſhould be the Chriſtians Work.</p>
               <p>How doth his Grace help the tempted Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever?</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>diſcovering of Satan's Wiles and Devices.</hi> Eph. 6.11. He hath <hi>fiery darts, ver.</hi> 16. and he hath <hi>Wiles</hi> alſo. His moſt dangerous Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are his moſt cunning ones. This <hi>Serpent hath his Subtilty,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.3. The leſs they be perceaved, the more dangerous Temptation is: And the more clearly they are ſeen, the more eaſily they are overcome. The Apoſtle owns this in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Leſt Satan ſhould get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</hi> Satan gets greateſt advantage of them that are, (and becauſe they are) <hi>ignorant of his devices.</hi> The caſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, is that of the <hi>inceſtuous Corinthian.</hi> He had ſinned greatly, the <hi>Church</hi> had not reſented it as they ought, <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>firſt Epistle, chap.</hi> 5.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:93776:142"/> chargeth them for their want of Zeal, commands them to caſt out that <hi>ſcandalous Member:</hi> The Lord bleſſeth that Letter and his Advice, both to that <hi>Church,</hi> and to <hi>the offending per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Now here lay <hi>Satan's Device;</hi> he that had puffed them up with Pride and Security in their former Carriage toward that Offender, when impenitent; ſeeks alſo to ſtir them up to an Uncharitable ſeverity towards him, when renewed again unto Repentance. And of this kind, are many of his Wiles: He drives Men to extreams on each hand. Thus many Profeſſors, are like the Devils Foot-balls, kicked about from one extream to another, and ſeldom are kept in the right midſt. The Devil keeps Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in Sin, as long as he can. If they awake againſt his Will, he runs them on deſpair; if Faith be wrought in them, he labours to make them turn the Grace of God into Wantonneſs. The Inſtances of his Devices are innumerable. The multitude and danger of his <hi>Wiles</hi> muſt be great; if we conſider, 1. His <hi>created State.</hi> A Spirit more knowing than Man. A <hi>ſinleſs Angel</hi> is a higher Creature than <hi>ſinleſs Adam</hi> was. 2. By his Fall he hath loſt Happineſs and Purity, but retains his Knowledge, which his Corruption hath turned into Craft, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and Wiles. 3. His long <hi>Experience</hi> in cheating of Men. 4. That in Men that his <hi>Wiles</hi> are propoſed to; it is to the <hi>Heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked,</hi> Jer. 17.9. It is to the <hi>Old man, which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt according to the deceitful luſts,</hi> Eph. 4.22. Such a Devil dealing with ſuch a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:93776:143"/> Heart, muſt have many dangerous Wiles. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Grace only can enable a Man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them; and it ſhould be much prayed for. Many have been skilful in the <hi>Theory</hi> and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Doctrine of <hi>Satan's Wiles,</hi> that have been, notwithſtanding, prevailed upon by them. A Man muſt know his own Heart well, and obſerve its motions narrowly, and be much at the Throne of Grace, that would know Satan's particular Wiles on himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace helps the Tempted, <hi>in helping to hate the ſin they are tempted to.</hi> Many Believers, though they cannot tell well, whence the Wind comes that drives them, whether from their own Heart, or the Devil; yet they know whither it drives them, to Sin that they are averſe from. Tempted <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſpake like a Man that had preſent aſſiſtance of Grace, when he ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> As far, and as long as the ſin tempted to, ſtands black and ugly in the eye of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted Perſon, ſo far and ſo long is the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ineffectual. Temptation prevails when the ſin tempted to, takes with the Heart and Will. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>A man is tempted</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſucceſsfully) <hi>when he is drawn away of his own luſt and enticed.</hi> Sin was without him, but near to him by the Temptation, now it is within him, and it is his ſin. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to numbering of the people took with <hi>David,</hi> but his Command about it, <hi>was abominable to Joab,</hi> a Man far ſhort
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:93776:143"/> of <hi>David</hi>'s Grace, if he had any, 1 <hi>Chron</hi> 21.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grace can help the Tempted to <hi>reſist and ſtand,</hi> Eph. 6.13. No Man is overcome of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> till he flee and yield. Reſiſting is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of him. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you.</hi> 1 Pet. 5.9. <hi>Whom reſiſt, ſtedfaſt in the faith.</hi> Eph. 6.16. <hi>Above all, taking the ſhield of faith, wherewith ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Devil.</hi> They are <hi>Darts,</hi> they are the <hi>Devils Darts,</hi> they are <hi>fiery Darts,</hi> there is an <hi>all</hi> of them; yet by Faith you may be able to <hi>quench</hi> them all. Why is ſo much ſaid of Faith? Becauſe as <hi>Chriſt's ſtrength</hi> is the <hi>Believers strength,</hi> ſo Faith is that only, in a Believer, that acts on this Strength, draws it in, and acts in it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Faith from its Object <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either in Juſtification, or in Sanctification, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an Imagination, a Vanity, a Nothing. Now conſider how cunningly <hi>Satan</hi> deals with Believers, and how ſimply they are gulled by him in Temptation. He perſwades, and often prevails with them, to lay aſide the Shield of Faith, when they ſhould mainly uſe it. How fooliſh were that Man that would yield his Arms to an implacable Enemy? <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew <hi>Peter</hi>'s danger, and provides graciouſly for it. <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> Luke 22.32.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The helping Grace of God, aſſiſts tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted Believers in <hi>preventing an utter Foyl by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and in <hi>recovering them from a begun Foyl.</hi> So did <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Cor. 12.8,9.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:93776:144"/> The Devil never gets all his Will on a Believer, nor are any Wounds he gives to a Saint, mortal in the iſſue, whatever they be in their own nature, in Believers Fears, or in the Devil's Deſign. All the Glory is due to the Grace that is in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly.</hi> Grace can <hi>rebuke the Tempter, and call him off:</hi> This <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High-Prieſt, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and got. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.2. <hi>And the Lord ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satan</hi> (who was ſtanding at <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s <hi>right hand to refiſt him, when he is ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord,</hi> ver. 1.) <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Jeruſalem, rebuke thee: Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</hi> This Mercy was the firſt thing in <hi>Paul's</hi> Prayer. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8. <hi>For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</hi> This Meſſenger of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> was of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſending and giving: <hi>There was given to me a thorn in the fleſh, a Meſſenger of Satan to buffet me.</hi> ver. 7. <hi>Lord ſave us from ſuch gifts,</hi> will Chriſtians be apt to ſay; there is no reaſon to pray for them; if the Lord ſee them needful, he will ſend them: But it is comfortable, that all the Devil's Aſſaults are of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ordering. He muſt have <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s leave to tempt, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31. And our Lord when he pleaſeth, can, and will call him off. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was tempted, <hi>Matth</hi> 4. he reſiſts all his Temptations by the Word, as his people ſhould; at laſt he put forth his Divine Power, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Get thee hence; Satan,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then the Devil leaveth him.</hi> This we cannot do, but Chriſt can do it for us.

But lift up your Heads by Faith on this Promiſe. Compleat Victory is coming, and the Faith of it, ſhould not only encourage you to reſiſt, but this Faith is a preſent Victory. <hi>Faith is our Victory,</hi> 1 John 5.4.

               <p>THE Lord hath been pleaſed, ſo to order and determine the State and Condition of his Children, while they are in this Life, that they ſhall be conſtantly needy. This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation we ſhould ſubmit unto with all quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, not quarrelling with the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Mercy of our God therein: Yea, more than Submiſſion is called for: There is a further Duty required, though it be hard to perform it,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:93776:145"/> to take pleaſure and to rejoice in this needy State, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon us. For as the Lord hath laid us, or left us under manifold Neceſſities: So hath he laid up, and is ready to lay out, of his Grace for help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us under them. And ſurely ſuch Wants as lay us open for thoſe Supplies of his Grace, will be found to have a great deal of Mercy in them, in the iſſue. The Exhortation in the Text implies, that Grace can help in every time of need. There are ſome times of need, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by the Lord on purpoſe, that the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his Grace might the more ſhine and appear. I was ſpeaking laſt day, from this Truth, That there are ſome ſpecial neceſſitous Times, in which Believers are ſpecially needy of Chriſt's Grace, and in which his Grace is ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally helpful.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoke to the firſt of theſe times of need: <hi>A time of Temptation:</hi> Though all Believers be not always tempted; yet there is no Saint on Earth, who is out the Devils Gun-ſhot. No Saint on Earth hath reaſon to expect, that (if I may ſo ſpeak) God ſhould ſerve the Devil with a <hi>Noli proſequi.</hi> God gives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this life, an utter diſcharge to the Devil, from medling with, or moleſting of any Saint. Till we come to Heaven, this Adverſary muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and prepared for. This World is his Dominion; he is the <hi>wicked God</hi> of it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. And all the wicked in it, are his people, Subjects, and Children: And all the remaining Corruption in the Saints, is of the Devil.</p>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:93776:146"/>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond time of ſpecial need of God's Grace, is, the time of a <hi>ſpiritual decay;</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in the New Creature, a decay in the Work of God in the Heart. This paſſeth under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Names in the Word, and well known in the Senſe and Experience of Believers. Sometimes it's called <hi>darkneſs. Iſa.</hi> 50.10. It is the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a natural State, that they that are in it, are <hi>darkneſs;</hi> it is the bleſſedneſs of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed State, that the partakers of it, <hi>are light in the Lord;</hi> their Duty is to <hi>walk as Children of light,</hi> Eph. 5.8. Though they that are made light in the Lord, are never ſuffered to become darkneſs again, yet they <hi>may walk in darkneſs, and have no light;</hi> and the <hi>days of that darkneſs may be many,</hi> as the wiſe Man ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11.8. We all know what <hi>natural darkneſs is.</hi> All the <hi>natural light</hi> of the World is from the Sun, and therefore natural Light and Darkneſs, Day and Night, have their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes and Revolutions, according to the ſhining or not ſhining of the Sun. All the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual light</hi> Believers have, is from the Light of God's Countenance, as the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ariſeth on them. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. or withdraws from them, ſo is their ſpiritual Day or Night; ſo do they walk in darkneſs, or in the Light of the Lord. Sometimes this Decay is called <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Deadneſs:</hi> A State of Inability, and Unactivity, for working and doing what they are called to. Hence ſo many Prayers for quickening, eſpecially in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. Natural Death we know not, but Sickneſs, Weakneſs, and Fainting we do know. Spiritual Death is known and felt by none that are under its to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:93776:146"/> power; but a Weakneſs in ſpiritual Life, Saints do know.</p>
               <p>Of this Decay I would ſpeak, in handling three things. 1. <hi>Whence it comes.</hi> 2. <hi>How needy ſuch are of God's Grace.</hi> 3. <hi>How Grace doth help in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whence comes this Decay on Chriſtians?</hi> It is a State too common to be queſtioned, and too plain to need to be proved, that true Chriſtians are, and may be in it. I would name ſome of its Springs and Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It flows from the <hi>Infant, infirm State of the new Creature,</hi> in its firſt forming. It is <hi>a new-born babe,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. When the <hi>firſt Man</hi> was made, he was as perfect and ſtrong a Man the firſt hour he was made, as ever he was in all his Life: He came out of his Maker's hands a perfect Man. But the new Creature is born a weak thing, and is to grow up to the <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a perfect man in Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.13. and will never come to its full growth, till it come to Heaven. None on Earth knows what a perfect Chriſtian is. There are degrees of Perfection on Earth, in reſpect whereof ſome are leſs, ſome more perfect; but the moſt perfect, labour greatly under Imperfection. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12,13,14. and preſs moſt after Perfection. I will not ſpeak of the wiſe deſign of God in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the new Creature thus. Only the glory of its preſervation, and of its Perfection, is not due to the new Nature in Believers, but to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of it, <hi>God the Father,</hi> to the bleſſed Root thereof, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his Son, to the <hi>Inhabitation of the Spirit,</hi> and to the great Security of the <hi>new Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:93776:147"/>
               <p n="2">2. The new Creature is not only in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, weak ſtate, but it <hi>is planted in bad and unfit Soil for it.</hi> It is planted out of its Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Heaven is the proper Element and Country, whence the new Creature came, whence it is maintained, and whether it natively tends. But it is planted here in the Heart of a ſinner. Now the Heart of a Man, though mended by Grace in part, is a very unfit and unſuitable Soil for ſuch a Foreign Heavenly Plant as the new Creation is. And hence it is, that the Grace of God in us, is endangered by the place of its Reſidence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is alſo <hi>much Corruption remaining in the Heart of a Believer,</hi> as noiſome Weeds growing near this precious planting of the Lord. The Lord never deſigned to root all Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the Hearts of his people in this life, by the firſt planting of his Grace in them, but only to give that Grace, that ſhall break the <hi>dominion of ſin;</hi> and that ſhall maintain a War with <hi>in-dwelling ſin,</hi> and at laſt ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail compleatly. So that it's plain, that on the account of thoſe three, if there were no more, Chriſtians are very lyable to ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays. And it's ſadly confirmed from frequent Experience. It may be in ſome, the work of Grace was in beſt caſe, when it was firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and that from the day of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, to the day of their being Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they never had much of any remarkable growth: But this is their Sin, and their Shame.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:93776:147"/>
               <p n="2">2. Hence you may ſee, <hi>how needy ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are of the help of the grace of God.</hi> An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward decay in the work of his Grace in us, makes us very needy of help from the Fountain of Grace in him.</p>
               <p>For this decay <hi>gives great advantages to our ſpiritual Enemies to attack us, and lays us under great diſadvantages in reſiſting them.</hi> I am apt to think (I cannot now give the reaſons of it) that the Devil knows the frame of our Hearts (though he do not know the Heart immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, that is God's Property. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.24.) and the Condition of the Work of God in us, a great deal better, than we our ſelves ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do. Great is the Intimacy he hath with our Spirits, eſpecially with the remaining Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them. Great is his Craft acquired by Obſervation, Practice and Experience, as well as by his malicious Sagacity. And when he ſeeth a Believer in a bad Caſe, if he have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he will improve that deſired oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to make their bad Caſe worſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.11,12. <hi>David</hi> prays for haſty help from God, on this Argument, his Enemies ſaying, <hi>God hath forſaken him, perſecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him. Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> encourage <hi>Iſrael</hi> to go in and poſſeſs the Land. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. by this, <hi>Their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us; fear them not.</hi> It is from this bad caſe that Believers are in, that Satan hath ſo eaſie and ſpeedy Victory over them at ſometimes, more than at other times. When it is well with the new Creation within, Chriſtians can keep the Devil at a Bay and Stand; when it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:93776:148"/> he prevails immediately; we are diſarmed, and his Darts pierce and enter. There is ſome ground to ſuſpect, that <hi>David</hi>'s Heart was not in ſo good a frame as uſually, ſometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his foul Fall. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. As to <hi>Peter</hi> it is plain; his vain-ſelf-confidence gave <hi>Satan</hi> an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſift him, as he did.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How doth the Grace of God help in a decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Grace helps, in <hi>preſerving Life at the Root.</hi> There is ſome witneſs for God kept up. <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Bride, Song</hi> 5.2. It is well, all was not aſleep. <hi>The ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak,</hi> ſaith meek <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his Agony in the Garden, to the three diſtempered Diſciples. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41. Theſe ſame <hi>three</hi> ſleep in the <hi>Mount of Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Luke 9.32. and in <hi>the Garden of Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Paul</hi> found this Witneſs preſerv'd in his Captivity to the Law in his Members. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace helps under a decayed State, by <hi>making a ſecret growth downward.</hi> A growth that the Believer cannot feel in himſelf, and that others cannot quickly perceave; yet it is a real growth, and will in God's due time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. We commonly value moſt that growth in Grace, that hath fair Bloſſoms and Fruit, appearing to our comfort, and to the Lord's Praiſe before others. And it is indeed deſirable and to be ſtudied. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>John.</hi> 15.8. But there is a growth that may be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in the Root only, in the rooting Grace of a Chriſtian. As in clearer Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of in-dwelling ſin in the Heart, and in
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:93776:148"/> more ſelf-diffidence and ſelf-diſtruſt. <hi>Paul</hi> had this Fruit. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8,9. It is a ſad thing, that many Chriſtians are ſo fond of themſelves, of the good that is in them, that the Lord ſeeth that nothing is ſo fit to cure them of this, as leaving them to themſelves. And when this leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them to themſelves, hath brought them to a diſcovery of themſelves, and that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hath wrought a diſtruſt of themſelves, and that diſtruſt hath taught them Faith in God, then the Lord hath reached his end on them, and will change his way with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grace can <hi>revive the decayed ſtate of a Believer.</hi> Pſal. 23.3. <hi>He restoreth my Soul. He reneweth their ſtrength.</hi> Iſa. 40.31. Pſal. 103.5. <hi>Thy youth is renewed like the Eagles.</hi> This is impoſſible in Nature and as to our Bodies; but as to our Souls, and the work of God in them, it is what is promiſed, and often done. <hi>Old people</hi> may, and do often, in their Folly and Vanity, counterfeit Youth; but all their Arts cannot make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one hour younger. But the Lord can renew the youth of the new Creature, and make it better with him, than ever it was. <hi>David</hi> prays for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within me. Peter</hi> got a new Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. They both had been convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and renewed before, but they fell under a ſad decay, and needed this reſtoring Grace, and got it. So much of the ſecond time of need. I proceed to a third, not ſo common.</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:93776:149"/>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>time of ſpecial Enjoyments,</hi> is a time of ſpecial need of God's helping Grace. You may think it ſtrange, but it is true, that they that receave moſt of the Lord's gracious bounty, ſtand in moſt need of Grace to guide it well. Concerning this ſeaſon, I would ſpeak in five Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Maſt Chriſtians know what thoſe Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are by experience, although it various meaſures.</hi> It is very ſuſpicious, that that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is an Hypocrite, that is always in the ſame frame, let them pretend, it to be never ſo good: The true Chriſtians Sky is never long clear and without Clouds; change of <hi>weather</hi> and <hi>ways,</hi> is uſually found by Travellers to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. It is to be ſuſpected that he is not right, <hi>who hath no changes,</hi> Pſal. 55.19. Theſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Enjoyments are of ſeveral ſorts. 1. There is ſome <hi>ſpecial nearneſs to God</hi> enjoyed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at ſome times. We are not at all to be offended at, but rather confirmed by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the Ungodly, that are utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to ſuch Enjoyments, and cannot endure nor underſtand the Scripture Names of ſuch Bleſſings, that they themſelves are unacquainted with. What is more frequent in the Word, than this <hi>nearneſs to God?</hi> What is better known in the Experience of Saints, than this nearneſs? He makes gracious Approaches to Mens Spirits, and cauſeth them to approach to him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. they find it good for them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.28. The firſt gracious change wrought in a Soul, is by bringing a diſtant ſinner near to God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometime were far off, are made nigh by
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93776:149" rendition="simple:additions"/> the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Whenever the Virtue of that Blood came upon you by the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> God came near to you, and you were brought near to God. But beſides this near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is begun in the firſt Application of Grace, and changeth their State, there is more nearneſs given by the Lord, and enjoyed by his people, for the cheering of their Hearts and bettering of their Frame. Exerciſed Chriſtians are able to give a diſtinct account of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this nearneſs at ſome times, and of their want of it at othe times. How much of both are in the <hi>Pſalm of David?</hi> And ſuch as can underſtand the <hi>nearneſs</hi> to, and <hi>diſtance</hi> from God, ſo frequently mentioned there, as only the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> ſenſe of God's favourable or croſs Providence towards him in outward things, are to be pitied for their ungodly lg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and deſpiſed for their expounding the Words of <hi>a man after God's heart,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the carnal Sentiments of their own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are <hi>Effuſions of the Spirit,</hi> ſpoke of in the Word, and found by Chriſtians, which are ſpecial Enjoyments. Sometimes they are found in the performance of ſpiritual Duties of Worſhip; ſometimes in the exerciſe of grace. Grace ſhould be acted in all Duties of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but it may be, and ſhould be, acted out of any formal Duty. You ſhould never pray, but there ſhould be acting of Faith and Love on <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But, God be thanked, you may act Faith and Love when ye do not pray, when you are about no ſetled ſpiritual Duty of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: there is a <hi>being in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Lord
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:93776:150"/> all the day long,</hi> Prov. 23.17. <hi>A walking up and down in the name of the Lord. Zech.</hi> 10.12. <hi>A doing of every thing in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Col. 3.17. Every Believer hath the Spirit of Chriſt: <hi>If any man have not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. But there are ſome ſingular Powrings out of this Spirit, promiſed and beſtowed, and well known by Believers, and they are precious Enjoyments. <hi>This ſpirit, the world cannot receave, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you;</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. 3. There is <hi>Communion and fellowſhip with God,</hi> much ſpoke of in the Word, well known by Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. But I ſhall name no more of theſe Enjoyments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As all Chriſtians know what theſe ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Enjoyments are, ſo all of them do greatly deſire them. This is ſo ſure, that many do over-deſire them. This deſire ariſeth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Genius and Inſtinct of the new Nature.</hi> What is more natural to the new Creature, than kindly breathing after Heaven? When a poor Soul hath got of the Water of Life from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it <hi>becomes in him a well of water, ſpringing up unto everlaſting life,</hi> John 4.14. Immediately the Soul ſaith, What ſhall I do to be ſaved? When ſhall I be ſaved? Now if deſires of Heaven be the native breathing of the new Creature; ſurely breathing after much of Heaven upon Earth, muſt be ſo too: For the higheſt Enjoyments of God on Earth, are far ſhort of what is reſerved for Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:93776:150"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Experience of firſt Love,</hi> and of the firſt gracious Welcome he gave to the Believer, when he firſt fled to the City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, makes them deſire more of thoſe Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe ſpecial Enjoyments <hi>are very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> as well as pleaſing. They are given for profit, and do uſually profit. 1. <hi>They are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting under Tribulation. In the multitude of my thoughts within me</hi> (and doubleſs they were ſad ones) <hi>thy comforts delight my Soul,</hi> Pſal. 94.19. Uſually <hi>much. Affliction and Joy of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> are together. 1 Theſ. 1.6. The Promiſes are fitted for diſtreſs, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them given to Chriſtians under it. Some diſtreſſes are ſo great, that nothing can bear up under them, but a ſpecial appearance of Divine Grace, and in that caſe, ſuch Bleſſings may be more importunately beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Special Enjoyments <hi>do fit and ſtrengthen for Work and Service.</hi> There is <hi>a joy of the Lord,</hi> that is the Believers <hi>Strength.</hi> Neh. 8.10. <hi>Flijah</hi>'s double Meal was to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> him for a forty days Journey in the Wilderneſs; and the extraordinary Manifeſtation he had of God, was to fit him for his Tranſlation, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. Many Saints have found this ſo often in their Experience, that they do with fear receave ſingular Enjoyments of God, becauſe they have ſo oft found them followed with ſome ſpecial Tryal and Difficulty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Although moſt Chriſtians have ſomewhat of theſe ſpecial Enjoyments, and all deſire them, and they be profitable in themſelves: Yet <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:93776:151"/> ſpiritual Enjoyments are dangerous,</hi> and render a Man very needy of the helping Grace of God. 1. Becauſe they <hi>do uſually expoſe to ſpecial Temptation.</hi> Satan is a conſtant Enemy to all Chriſtians; but there are two times ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that he would faineſt aſſault the Believer; <hi>when he is at his worſt,</hi> and <hi>when he is at beſt.</hi> Let Believers be never ſo low, if Satan get his Will, he would bring them lower: No Man is as low as the Devil would have him, but he that is in Hell: but thither he cannot bring a Believer. If a Chriſtian be never ſo high, if the Devil be let looſe upon him, he will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring him down. Do not think that the Devil will fear to engage a Believer, even when in his beſt State. He that had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to fall on <hi>ſinleſs Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> will think it an eaſie matter to deal with any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man in this Wilderneſs: He that had the Impudence to tempt our <hi>Almighty ſinleſs Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;</hi> will he have either modeſty or fear, in tempting a feeble Believer? You whom the Lord makes at any time to ride on your high Places, bleſs him, and yet fear your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are ſome ſpecial Corruptions, that are apt to grow under ſpecial Enjoyments,</hi> as Weeds by warm Sun-ſhine. If there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Enjoyment of God to be found in this Life, as would remove Corruption altogether out of the Heart, there would be no fear of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it: But now, when the greateſt Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can be had in this Life, are given to them, that have a body of death dwelling in them; there are ſome workings of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93776:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> Corruption, that are very ready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>As, 1. <hi>Pride of Heart; ſpiritual Pride.</hi> All Pride is a ſpiritual ſin; but Pride that riſeth on ſpiritual Bleſſings receaved, is ſpecially <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Pride.</hi> Pride on the account of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of body, or Strength, or Riches, is a <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fooliſh Pride.</hi> If it riſe on the account of Gifts and Endowments of the Mind, it grows yet a worſe Pride. But if the Gifts of God be yet of a more high and noble kind, as his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Love, and the precious fruits of that Love, in begun Conformity to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, if Pride riſe on ſuch grounds, it is yet the <hi>worſt of all ſorts of Pride:</hi> For the more precious the Gifts of God be, and the more eminently they be of free diſtinguiſhing Grace, and the more plainly the deſign of God in giving thoſe Gifts, be to glorifie the Grace of the Giver, and to ſave the Receaver to the Praiſe of that Grace, Pride of Heart on the account of ſuch Gifts, is yet the worſt of all Pride. Now that ſuch a Corruption may grow under ſpecial Enjoyments of God, is paſt all doubt. 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 12. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his being lifted up unto Heaven, like a Man that had not fully recovered himſelf. <hi>I knew a man in Chriſt above fourteen years ago (whether out of the body, or in the body, I know not, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.)</hi> It was a long while ſince, but in the time of the Enjoyment, and fourteen Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, he could not tell, whether he was in, or out of the body. He never ſpeaks plainly of it, till he came to ſpeak of his Infirmities, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93776:152" rendition="simple:additions"/> through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the fleſh, a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Satan to buffet me, leſt I ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above meaſure.</hi> Where we may perceave plainly, that whatever was in that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Enjoyment <hi>Paul</hi> had, in that Viſion from Heaven, or in that Viſit to Heaven, that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, when he came back he found the ſame Heart he had formerly felt, and the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Death he ſo often had groan'd under before. Although we know not what <hi>Paul</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in that time, nor what the nature of that Exerciſe by Satan was that he was put to, yet the <hi>Lord's deſign</hi> and <hi>Paul's danger</hi> is plain. It is indeed a marvellous Paſſage. Such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Perſon as <hi>Paul</hi> was, the chief of the Apoſtles, and moſt eminent Saint in all the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> after ſuch a great Revelation, muſt be exerciſed with Hell, to prevent harm by his being in Heaven, before he was fully rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and fit for Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Contentedneſs with a preſent good condition, and dulneſs of deſires after a better State,</hi> is a common Corruption that is apt to riſe up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpecial Enjoyments. If the Diſciples be on the <hi>Mount of Transfiguration,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> be glorified in their ſight, and <hi>glorified Saints</hi> from Heaven in his Company; then <hi>its good to be here,</hi> ſay they; not minding that which was more needful for them and all the Church; and if they heard (as is moſt likely) the Diſcourſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> concerning the <hi>Deceaſe of our Lord, which he ſhould accompliſh at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> Luke 9 30,31. they were the more faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is very hard to be truly deſirous of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93776:152"/> Heaven, when we have much of Heaven on Earth; yet it may be attained, and Grace can help to it. Of which in the laſt place.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Grace of God, as it is needed, <hi>ſo is it uſeful and helpful to Believers under ſpecial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Grace can <hi>humble the Soul under them, and by them.</hi> Though Satan make them Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Pride, the Lord can ſanctifie them to be means of humbling. Great Comforts do not natively tend to humble us, but all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of the Glory of God, are humbling. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> found it ſo. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, for mine Eyes have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> The Viſion was great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, it was a ſight of God in Chriſt; as <hi>John</hi> 12.41. <hi>Theſe things ſaid Eſaias when he ſaw his glory and ſpake of him.</hi> We would be apt to think the Prophet ſhould rather have ſaid, <hi>Happy am I that I have ſeen now what I never ſaw before, what few, if any, beſides me, have ſeen.</hi> But ſuch was the Impreſſion the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God made on the Heart of this Man, that this extraordinary Manifeſtation of God affects him with more deep ſelf-abaſement, than ever he had before. Happy is the Man that lies ſtill the more low in himſelf, and before God, the more highly the Lord exalts him. <hi>Job</hi> found this fruit of a clearer diſcovery of God, <hi>chap.</hi> 42.5,6. <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.30. <hi>Called the name of the place, Penuel, for I have ſeen God face to face, and my life is preſerved.</hi> This place where he wreſtled all night with the Lord; where the Lord bleſſed him in the morning; this place he calls <hi>Penuet,</hi> to be the name of it
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93776:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> to him and his Seed, that whenever they ſaw the place, or heard of it, they might remember that there <hi>the great God</hi> and <hi>a poor Man</hi> met in great familiarity, and the Man was not conſumed. <hi>Jacob</hi> wonders that his Life was preſerved in ſuch a meeting. Near Approaches of God to his Children, are ſometimes too hard for them to bear. This made <hi>one eminent Saint</hi> cry out under ſuch a high Enjoyment, <hi>O Lord deſtroy me not with thy Glory;</hi> and another, <hi>Hold thy hand, O Lord, thy ſervant is a clay Veſſel, and can bear no more.</hi> And both theſe were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not oppreſſed by his Wrath, but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with his Love and Glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace can help to <hi>record and remember ſpecial Enjoyment.</hi> There are ſome ſpiritual Enjoyments of God, that are like Lightening, that dart from the one end of Heaven to the other, that make a dark night to become like the Morning; they come quickly, and they are quickly gone; they are of ſpeedy Acceſs, and of as ſudden a Receſs. But though they be but ſhort in their continuance, their fruit may remain: And one way for making their fruit continue, is to remember and record them. I will remember the <hi>Years,</hi> the <hi>Works,</hi> the <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.10,11,12. I <hi>will meditate,</hi> I <hi>will talk</hi> of them, ſaith the Saint. Thus <hi>David</hi> prays for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>Keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the Heart of thy people.</hi> What was <hi>this</hi> he prayed for <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s remembring of, and for the Lord's keeping in their minds? It was that they might remember with what joy they made their willing Offerings for the Service
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93776:153"/> of God. We have a gracious Promiſe of <hi>Chriſt, John</hi> 14.26. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> And this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe we ſhould plead, for bringing to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the things <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>done for us,</hi> as well as for what he <hi>hath ſaid to us:</hi> And no Man can imagine (but they that feel it) how one of theſe Remembrances will fortifie the Soul in a day of diſtreſs. Spiritual things are ſo unlike to carnal things, that all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons betwixt them muſt needs halt greatly. That a poor, hungry, ſtarving Man, ſhould in a Dungeon, or deſolate Wilderneſs, be refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made ſtrong, by the bare remembrance of a Feaſt he had ſeven years ago; this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in nature. But in ſpiritual things it is otherwiſe. The ſavoury remembrance of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enjoyment, long ſince paſt, can bring back the taſte and power and virtue of it, to the Soul that wants it. Believers are uſually upon their recovery from a ſad diſconſolate State, when they are exerciſed in remembring with Savour their former Enjoyments. Thus ſaith <hi>Returning Iſrael, Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I will go, and return to my firſt Husband, for then it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with me, than now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Grace can help, to <hi>improve Enjoyments, to deſires of, and endeavours after Perfection.</hi> We muſt not ſay, when it is well with us, <hi>it is good to be here,</hi> but rather, <hi>it is good to be there, where it will be a great deal better.</hi> Phil. 3.13. <hi>This one thing I do;</hi> it muſt be a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93776:154"/> 
                  <hi>great thing</hi> doubtleſs, that is <hi>Paul's one thing: Forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I preſs toward the mark,</hi> &amp;c. There is a <hi>forgetting</hi> that is our Duty, and a <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,</hi> that is our Duty alſo. To <hi>remember</hi> ſo as to ſupport our Faith, and feed our praiſing of the Lord, that is Duty; but to forget <hi>Attainments,</hi> ſo as to preſs after the mark, that is another Duty. Alas! we are bad, both at <hi>right remembring</hi> and <hi>right for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting.</hi> You and I think, that if we had but a little of what <hi>Paul</hi> had in one day; if we had but a little of what he had that night he lay in the Stocks, when he <hi>prayed and ſang praiſes unto God,</hi> Acts 16.25. we could never have forgotten it, as long as we had a day to live. But <hi>Paul</hi> could forget all in his ardent deſires of Perfection: And ſo muſt you; and this Grace can teach you.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſpecial Enjoyments of God are but rarely felt. Dote not on them, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, mock not ſuch as know them in their Experience, though ye do not. If you be ſound Believers, ye may live in your Souls, and live to his Praiſe, without enjoying any thing very extraordinary. But if the Lord grant ſingular Communications of himſelf, know that it is a ſeaſon of ſpecial need of Grace to guide them well. They would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn more frequently, and would riſe and ſpring higher, and laſt longer, if they were better improved, The greater the Bleſſing be, the more
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93776:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> provoking is the abuſe of it. The greater the Bleſſing be, the greater is the difficulty of guiding it well: And the more difficulty be in our Work, the more is our need of the Grace of God; and the more frequent and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſhould our Applications be to Throne of Grace, for that <hi>needful, helpful Grace.</hi>

               <p>HAving ſpoke of the <hi>need of God's Grace,</hi> and of its <hi>help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> in general, I came to condeſcend on ſome Seaſons, wherein the Grace of God is ſpecially <hi>needful</hi> and <hi>help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Of them, I named <hi>ſix; three</hi> of which I have ſpoke to, and the other <hi>three</hi> remain to be handled.</p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:93776:155"/>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Seaſon named, was the <hi>time of Temptation.</hi> There was never a Believer ſo little beloved of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as to be given up as a Prey to Satan: And never lay a Believer ſo near Chriſt's Heart, but the Devil may get him into his Sieve. Therefore let us never flatter our ſelves in a <hi>ſtate of ſecurity</hi> from diſturbance by the Devil; bleſſed be God, we are brought into a <hi>ſtate of ſafety</hi> from ruin by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A Seaſon of <hi>ſpiritual decay:</hi> Soul-ſickneſs, a weakneſs in the New Creature. There are ſome People that never knew by Experience what bodily ſickneſs means, but have enjoyed perfect Health all their Life. But I am apt to think, that few, if any, Chriſtians, find it ſo as to the new Creation in them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Seaſon of <hi>ſpecial Enjoyments.</hi> Though theſe two ſeem to be very far from, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to one another, yet they agree in this, that in both Grace is <hi>needful</hi> and <hi>helpful.</hi> The unaccountable Wiſdom and Sovereignty of the Lord our God, ſhines in his conduct of his People. Some of them have extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavings; others know little what they mean. There are ſome Chriſtians, whoſe way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lyes all along in the Depths and in the Vales, when others ride on their High places: Now theſe ſingular manifeſtations from God, though deſirable and profitable, yet are not without ſpecial dangers; to prevent which, the Lord provides and miniſters ſpecial Phyſick to them; and it is ſtrong and unpleaſant, but the Phyſician can bleſs it. As <hi>Paul</hi>'s Experience witneſſeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. He had been in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:93776:156"/> he knew not <hi>how;</hi> he had heard he could not tell <hi>what,</hi> when he came back. But he well knew what he met with on his return, and how needful and uſeful it was for him. Leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure with what he had ſeen and heard in Paradiſe, Hell is ſent to humble him. May we not infer this, How unfit are Believers, while in the body, and a body of death is in them, to be in Heaven, when any ſpecial Enjoyment of Heaven, muſt have ſo dreadful a Remedy adminiſtred to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent hurt?</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Seaſon of ſpecial need of Grace, is the time <hi>of Affliction.</hi> Afflictions are of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts and kinds. I am apt to believe, that though there be ſome likeneſs in the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many, yet every afflicted Man hath a particular Affliction of his own. As it is with peoples <hi>Faces,</hi> ſo is it with their <hi>Croſſes.</hi> For as many thouſand Faces as are amongſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, though all are ſomewhat like, yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath ſome diſtinction. The World is full of Croſſes, yet every afflicted Perſon hath his own Croſs. Our Lord hints at it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Let a man take up his Croſs.</hi> The Lord appoints a proper Croſs for every one. Though people are ready to think and ſay, that their Croſs is unfit for them, and that they would bear another Croſs better. In Croſſes we muſt neither chooſe, nor refuſe. (<hi>David</hi>'s Caſe was ſingular. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.) The Lord choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for us, and we muſt not, cannot refuſe. <hi>Job</hi> 34.35. <hi>Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompenſe it, whether thou refuſe, or whether thou chuſe, and not I: therefore
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:93776:156" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſpeak what thou knowest.</hi> There is a general diſtinction of Afflictions: Some are <hi>from God's hand,</hi> for <hi>Sin,</hi> or <hi>Tryal,</hi> or <hi>prevention:</hi> And ſome are <hi>from Man's hand</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake and the <hi>Goſpel</hi>'s. In all of them Grace is helpful and needful. But I would ſpeak only ſomething in general, that every one may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to themſelves, according to their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Exerciſe: And that on theſe two Heads. 1. The <hi>needfulneſs</hi> of Grace to the afflicted. 2. The <hi>helpfulneſs</hi> of Grace to the afflicted, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Affliction be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>need of the grace of God to the afflicted.</hi> Some ſenſe of this, is engraven on the Hearts of Men by the Light of Nature. The Heathen Mariners in the Storm, expreſs this. <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.5.6. <hi>What meaneſt thou O ſleeper? ariſe, call upon thy God, if ſo be God will think upon us, that we periſh not.</hi> A ſad caſe. A Heathen Ship-maſter challenging a Godly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for his neglect of ſeeking God: He calls him by a ſhameful, but well deſerved name, <hi>O Sleeper.</hi> The Storm came on for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>'s ſake, as he told them <hi>ver.</hi> 12. yet he is the ſecureſt perſon in the Ship. He only knew God, yet he is laſt in calling on him. An <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Pagan may out-do a diſtempered Prophet in ſome things, at ſome times.</hi> This Senſe was expreſſed greatly by the King, Nobles, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Nineveh, Jonah</hi> 3.5,10. And they again go far beyond <hi>Jonah.</hi> They belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God on <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Preaching, <hi>repented, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>faſted,</hi> and <hi>the Lord repented of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> But <hi>Jonah</hi> was grieved at all, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.1,2. If were not for his excellent Prayer, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:93776:157" rendition="simple:additions"/> and that he was a <hi>Prophet of the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Pen-man of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to record his own Sin and Shame, for the benefit of the Church, we ſhould be tempted to queſtion this Man's grace, of whoſe fearful Sins we have ſo large an Account. He rebel's againſt the Lord's Call to preach to <hi>Nineveh:</hi> When he flees, the Lord overtakes him by a Storm, takes, him by the Lot, he is caſt into the Sea, ſcoold in the Whale's Belly three days and three nights; a miraculous Chaſtiſement, and a miraculous Preſervation. He now obeys the repeated call; but when his labour had a gracious Effect, he is diſpleaſed exceedingly, and prays moſt ſinfully. <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Inſtance ſhould teach Miniſters and Chriſtians to pray more, <hi>Lord lead us not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Temptation.</hi> As Nature's Light teacheth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people, their need of the Lord's Grace and Mercy, the Word declares it more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. This need of the helping grace of God in Affliction, I would inſtruct in theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Affliction-ſins are readily fallen into, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of the Grace of God.</hi> Such Sins I mean, that Affliction doth eaſily and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempt unto; as <hi>Fretting, Impatience, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,</hi> and <hi>quarrelling with the hand of God.</hi> It is ſadly and frequently ſeen, that Affliction hath not only brought along with it diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Sin, but alſo the Actings and Workings of more Corruption, than either the Perſon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any elſe thought was in the Man. It was a ſad Character of a very bad Man. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. <hi>And in the time of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, did he treſpaſs yet more againſt the Lord;
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:93776:157" rendition="simple:additions"/> this is that King Ahaz.</hi> This is a Man noted for <hi>a never-do-well.</hi> A Brother <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and <hi>in the ſame Iniquity,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what ſhould I wait for the Lord any longer?</hi> 2 Kings 6.33.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Affliction-Duties are only practicable by the help of the Grace of God.</hi> Every Croſs hath its Work, as well as its Tryal. There is that required and called for in Affliction, that craves a ſpecial Aſſiſtance of the grace of God, for the doing of it. It is remarkable, that the great Duty of the afflicted, is expreſſed by two Negatives. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. from <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.11. <hi>My Son deſpiſe not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him.</hi> What then is the poſitive Duty? It is that which is neither of theſe two; if the Affliction be <hi>light,</hi> we are apt to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> it; and if it <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> we are as apt <hi>to faint under it.</hi> But, ſaith the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſee that ye do neither; if it be never <hi>ſo light,</hi> do not <hi>deſpiſe it;</hi> if it be never <hi>ſo heavy, faint not under it.</hi> And there is no ſmall need of Grace to preſerve us from thoſe Extreams, and to keep us in the right midſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Conſolations of an afflicted State are very needful, and Grace only can furniſh us with them.</hi> Be ye aſſured of it, that never did a Chriſtian bear up patiently under God's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy hand, but by the ſtrong ſecret Working of ſome Conſolation. It is true, we value and ſeek moſt that Conſolation, that comes in as a great Flood of Senſe, and that doth ſwallow up the bitterneſs of Affliction. This the Lord can, and ſometimes doth, give to his
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:93776:158" rendition="simple:additions"/> People. But there is a ſecret, ſilent ſpring of Conſolation, that is as profitable, and more common in the Lord's way with his Children. Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3,4,5. <hi>Everlaſting conſolation and good hope through grace,</hi> are his Bleſſings. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16,17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wherein the helpfulneſs of grace doth conſiſt, in an afflicted ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. God's grace helps <hi>with Light to know God's mind in affliction.</hi> It is dreadful to be ſtruck in the dark, when a Man neither ſeeth the Path he walks in, nor the Hand that ſmiteth him, nor the Weapon he is ſmote with. The great Bleſſing that grace can help us to, is to know what the Rod means, what its voice is, who hath appointed it, and what of God's Name is written on the Rod. <hi>Micah</hi> 6.9. <hi>Job</hi> was very earneſt for this Light, <hi>Job</hi> 10.2. <hi>I will ſay unto God, do not condemn me; ſhew me wherefore thou contendest with me. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihu</hi> adviſeth him well. <hi>Job</hi> 34.31,32. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> Many a poor Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever have been put to this, that if they had all the World, they would have parted with it, to have known God's Mind in their Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Sometimes by the Light of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, we come to know our Hearts and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and thereby what God ſmites for, and calls to. The Lord can by the teachings of his Word and Spirit, and by the Wiſdom of his providential Diſpenſations, engrave that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Meaning that is in his Heart, on the Rod
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:93776:158"/> that is in his Hand, that Men may know it. And happy is that perſon that is ſo dealt with. But it is indeed harder, to be ſincerely wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to know and admit of God's Mind in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, than it is to find it out. But his grace can help to both, and the Throne of Grace ſhould be much plyed for both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Grace can <hi>give in ſtrength and ſupport un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Affliction.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16. <hi>For which cauſe we faint not; but though our outward man pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</hi> It is a wonderful thing to ſee how much Pain, Sickneſs, and Torment, a poor frail body is able to bear; we think how cloſe and ſticking a thing is Life, that is not ſqueezed out by ſuch a ſtreſs? Yet the frailty of the Fleſh in bearing the diſtreſs of the Fleſh, is a ſmall thing, in regard of the frailty of the Heart in bearing of God's Rebukes. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. <hi>The ſpirit of a man will bear his Infirmity: but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Yet many have born it; but ſurely by divine Support. It is the common Senſe of diſtreſſed Chriſtians, that they have been put to bear ſuch burdens, that they thought at firſt they would ſurely have cruſhed them. The reaſon of their Wonder is, becauſe the weight of the burden upon them was ſenſible, but the <hi>everlaſting arms underneath them and their burden,</hi> were not ſeen. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grace helps in Affliction, <hi>by enabling the afflicted to believe that there is Love in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicter.</hi> He ſaith it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten:</hi> And he can make us believe it. Nothing but his mighty Grace can do it. Nothing is liker <hi>Anger,</hi> than <hi>Affliction,</hi>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:93776:159"/> eſpecially when ſevere; nothing is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to believe, than that (which to all our Senſe and Reaſon is ruining to us) ſhould be in love in him that doth it. Who can believe this, without the help of Grace? and how great muſt that help be, that enableth a Man to believe ſo unlikely a thing?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Grace helps in Affliction, <hi>by teaching to profit thereby.</hi> Heb. 12.11. <hi>Now no chaſtening for the preſent, ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous: Nevertheleſs, afterward it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them which are exerciſed thereby.</hi> The fruit of ſanctified Affliction is a great Myſtery, as all ſpiritual Fruit is. You cannot tell how you profit by the Word: I am afraid that there is but little profiting at all; but they that do profit, cannot tell how they profit. They may ſee the Seed ſown, they may find it ſown in their Hearts, they may perceave its Fruits in their Worſhip and Walk; but how the grace of God works with the Word in making them profit, is too deep for the moſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians. It is ſome way more myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, how the Lord works out profit by Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is indeed often found, bleſſed be his Name. Many can ſay with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray: but now have I kept thy word. ver.</hi> 71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> But none can tell how the grace of God makes the bitter feed of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction bring forth the peaceable fruit of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. And where is that Saint, who, when the Lord is writing bitter things againſt
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:93776:159" rendition="simple:additions"/> him, and multiplying his wounds, can ſay in Faith? <q rend="inline">Now, at this time, and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Lord is ſowing that Seed in me, that ſhall ſpring up in Fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to his Praiſe, and my certain Profit; and that the day will come, wherein I ſhall bleſs his Name from my Heart, for all the Sorrows I now feel and mourn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay no more of this Head of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only would give you this warning. Afflictions are very common, and much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of. Some Profeſſors ſpend all the little Religion they have, upon their Afflictions. Take heed to your Hearts under Afflictions. It is to be bewailed, that many Chriſtians, their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions come on them, they know not <hi>whence;</hi> they lye on them, they know not not <hi>wherefore;</hi> and they go off, they know not <hi>how:</hi> that if I may allude to ſuch ſacred Words, and apply the Phraſe to ſuch a ſinful Frame, Afflictions come on many, and they feel the ſmart of them, but <hi>know not whence they come, nor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go.</hi> They come on them when they are ſent, and go off when they are called; but they neither knew what God meant by them, nor did by them. No Chriſtian can ever make a ſpiritual and hearty Song of Praiſe for Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, unleſs there be ſome Senſe, or Hope of Profit thereby. If the Profit be ſeen, the Wiſdom and Love of God in afflicting, will be heartily acknowledged.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Time of ſpecial need of the grace of God, is <hi>a time of ſpecial Duty and Service to God, called for.</hi> All the courſe of our Life is to be
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:93776:160" rendition="simple:additions"/> conſtant Service; we ought to live to his Praiſe; we are made, as Creatures, and as new Creatures, for this end, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. But there are ſome Seaſons in which ſpecial Work is called for, and then there is great need of grace to help in that Hour. It is a mighty Word of the Preacher. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Becauſe to every purpoſe there is time and judgment, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the miſery of man is great upon him.</hi> And it is only <hi>the wiſe man's heart that diſcerneth time and Judgment, ver.</hi> 5. I would name four of thoſe times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The time that <hi>Men are called to believe on Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to ſecure their eternal Salvation by a full cloſing with him. This is a <hi>now,</hi> a <hi>day,</hi> an <hi>accepted time,</hi> a <hi>day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. All that hear the Goſpel, are bound by the Call of God in it, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the Promiſe of it, to receave by Faith, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and eternal Life, every time they hear the Goſpel. But ſometimes this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſpecially called for, which if neglected, may be of fatal conſequence to Men. Hence that Exhortation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near.</hi> When <hi>Chriſt</hi> is knocking at the Door of the Heart, then it is ſpecial Duty to open to him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. This was the day <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had, and neglected, and that that <hi>Chriſt</hi> mourned over them for. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41,42. Unſpeakable is Mens need of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing help of grace, when their Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are warmed with the Calls of grace in the Goſpel. In ſuch Seaſons, the everlaſting Bargain is either fixed by the power of grace
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:93776:160" rendition="simple:additions"/> working Faith in the Heart; or people are left to themſelves, and are further from Heaven than ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Some <hi>ſpecial Call to Men to give their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to Chriſt and his Goſpel by ſuffering.</hi> The Lord comes and craves Mens Teſtimony to his Truth, and chargeth them thus: If thou haſt any love to me and my Honour, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thy Witneſs, venture thy all, take up thy Croſs. Many Chriſtians have neglected ſuch trying Seaſons, which, in vain and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully, they have wiſhed for again. There is much of God's Grace needful to diſcern theſe Seaſons, and wiſely to improve them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another remarkable Seaſon of Mens need of God's Grace to help them in, and that is, <hi>The Seaſon of the Lord's calling them to a Duty-Tryal:</hi> A <hi>Duty</hi> called to by <hi>way of Tryal.</hi> The Lord gives the Call to try Men, and very great are the Conſequences of obeying or diſobeying of ſuch a Call. Many inſtances are of this in the Word. One is in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. The Paſſage is plain and awful. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been above a Year in the Wilderneſs, <hi>twelve Spies</hi> are ſent to view the Land; they all bring back an evil Report, ſave <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb;</hi> the People murmur, God threatens them with Judgments: They ſeem to be ſenſible of their Sin, it's like by the Plague that ſlew the <hi>ten falſe Spies, ver.</hi> 37. and by what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to them. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Sin, and reſolve to go up next Morning, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, they <hi>now ſinned again, and that the Lord was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ver.</hi> 41, 42. What ſevere dealing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:93776:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> is this? The Lord was among them veſterday, not this morning. They were bid go up yeſterday, they are forbid next morning. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not, what the Lord bid them do in <hi>his time,</hi> he will not protect them when they do the ſame thing in <hi>their time.</hi> Thus <hi>Saul</hi> was tryed twice. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. <hi>Samuel</hi> bid him tarry for him ſeven days at <hi>Gilgal Saul</hi> tarried ſix days, and part of the ſeventh, and then offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacrifice; not, as I think, that he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Prieſt's Office himſelf, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome Prieſt to do it: <hi>Profane Princes never want profane Chaplains.</hi> What a ſevere Sentence doth <hi>Samuel</hi> pronounce againſt him? <hi>ver.</hi> 13.14. Again, the ſame Man is tryed with another Duty. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. and fails there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and is puniſhed therefore. This ſort of trying Men by Duty, is like that in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.14.20. which <hi>Eliſha</hi> did put <hi>Joaſh</hi> unto. How may of the people of God, through the want of the preſent help of Grace, in ſome <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Trials,</hi> have ſtepped into ſuch Paths, and have fallen into ſuch Pits and Snares, as they have never got well and clearly out of, as long as they lived?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a Seaſon of great need of Grace to help us in, <hi>when the Lord by his Providence puts ſeveral things in a perſons choice, and leaves them to chooſe.</hi> The fulleſt of this kind, was that offer made to <hi>David</hi> about Judgments. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.12,13. A hard choice; but <hi>David</hi> did chooſe wiſely. His Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Offer, but it was of Bleſſings, and not of Judgments, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Ask what I ſhall give thee.</hi> And he choſe wiſely, and by his choice
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:93776:161"/> proved that he had already receaved a good meaſure of Wiſdom. <hi>Moſes</hi> had a great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and things of vaſt difference were in his Choice; and he choſe like a Man taught of God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24,25,26. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his laſt Sermon to <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 30.15,19. puts them on chooſing. <hi>I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you, that I have ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and curſing, therefore chooſe life, that both thou and thy ſeed may live; that thou mayeſt love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cleave unto him, for he is thy life, and the length of thy days.</hi> So did his Succeſſor <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when he had ſetled <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the promiſed Land, a little before his death. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. <hi>Chuſe ye this day whom ye will ſerve. Elijah</hi> did ſo with Apoſtate <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like this, is laid before Men in the daily Miniſtry of the Word. <hi>The Curſe of the Law,</hi> or <hi>the Bleſſing of the Goſpel,</hi> is in Mens Offer: And Men get as they chooſe. If Men refuſe the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> the <hi>Curſe</hi> belongs to them. If <hi>they receave the Bleſſing,</hi> they are <hi>delivered from the Curſe.</hi> But the <hi>chuſing,</hi> I mean, is that the Lord puts Men often to, in the ſeveral Turns of his Providence towards them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.12. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord? him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chooſe.</hi> Many gracious Promiſes are in the Word, of God's guiding of his people, many Prayers put up by Saints in the Word for this gracious guiding, and many Praiſes rendered to the Lord, for their bleſſed experience of his gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Who can walk ſafely through this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:93776:162" rendition="simple:additions"/> without the <hi>pillar of cloud by day,</hi> and <hi>the pillar of fire by night?</hi> How many of Mens Sorrows may be laid on their being left of God, in chooſing for themſelves? and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Mercies are owing to the Lord's gracious guiding of us in doubtful Caſes? But it is a very hard thing to ask Direction from God. <hi>Three</hi> faults are common in this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. 1. <hi>Pre-engagement of Heart.</hi> As it is a great ſin, after Vows to make inquiry, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25. So is it, to ask Direction from God, when Men are reſolved on the way they will take. An eminent inſtance of this ſinful Frame, we have in <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. and 43. They ſought Counſel of God by the Prophet in a great ſtraight, they promiſed to follow it whatever it was, God gives his Mind, they reject it, becauſe it ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not their Inclinations. It is no eaſie thing to ask Direction of God, with an undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Frame. 2. <hi>Pride of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Men think they are wiſe enough to chooſe their own way. Therefore that Command ſhould be much minded, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5,6,7. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding: In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths. Be not wiſe in thine own eyes.</hi> And that other Word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.24. <hi>Man's goings are of the Lord; how can a man then understand his own way?</hi> Prov. 16.9. <hi>A man's heart deviſeth his way, but the Lord directeth his ſteps.</hi> 3 <hi>Haſtey Men wait not for God's Counſel.</hi> Pſal. 106.13. and therefore go without it, and ſtumble in dark Paths. <hi>He that believeth, maketh not haste.</hi> Iſa 28.16. A little more <hi>patient wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:93776:162"/> on the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.1. hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten brought in determining Light in doubtful Caſes.</p>
               <p>So much for the fifth Seaſon of need of Grace.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The laſt time of need of Grace, is the <hi>time of dying.</hi> It is indeed the laſt, for he that is helped by Grace in that Time, will need no more help of Grace to eternity. This time of dying, is what we ſhould all think on; and if you think aright on it, it will not be unwelcome to hear of it.</p>
               <p>On this I would ſhow, 1. The <hi>need of Grace.</hi> 2. And the <hi>help of Grace</hi> in this laſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>time of need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>need of Grace to help in this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Though all Men have ſome Conviction of it, yet to ſtrengthen that Conviction, I would ſpeak to a few things about it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This time of need <hi>is unavoidable,</hi> it is a time that muſt come. Other times of need <hi>may come,</hi> and <hi>may not come.</hi> We <hi>may be tempted, we may be afflicted, we may be tryed, we may be caſt down, and we may be lifted up again;</hi> but die <hi>we muſt.</hi> It is <hi>appointed for men once to die,</hi> Heb. 9.27. As ſure as we live, we muſt die: We <hi>live our appointed time,</hi> and we <hi>die at our appointed time. Job</hi> 14.5,14. and all our <hi>times are in his hand,</hi> Pſal. 31.15. Eccleſ. 3.2. <hi>There is a time to be born, and a time to die.</hi> ver. 11. <hi>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time.</hi> That Man muſt have better Eyes, than thoſe of Fleſh, that can ſee any <hi>Beauty</hi> in Death. If there had been but <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> of Mankind,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:93776:163" rendition="simple:additions"/> that had lived from <hi>Noah</hi> to this day, and had been priviledged with an Exemption from this general Appointment, every Fool on Earth would have dreamt that, it may be, he ſhall partake of the ſame Priviledge alſo. But when all that ever breathed from <hi>Adam</hi> to this day, are dead (ſave the preſent Generation, whom a few more years will ſweep away, as it hath done their Predeceſſors) what Folly is there in Mens thoughtleſneſs of this unavoidable Fate? But if you ſay, <hi>all ſhall not die, but be changed,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. Conſider that this <hi>change</hi> is to them, as <hi>death</hi> is to us; and, it may be, will be as terrible to the Saints alive then, as Death now is. As Believers now dread not <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>to be dead,</hi> ſo much, as they fear <hi>to die;</hi> the <hi>State</hi> of the dead in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is not terrible, but the Paſſage to it is: So they that are <hi>changed at Chriſt's coming,</hi> may have the ſame Sentiments, till the <hi>change</hi> be wrought on them. It is (though none knows the particular manner of it) a putting off of Mortality and Corruption, and a putting on the Robes of Immortality and Incorruption. The ſame is done as to every Saint at <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:</hi> Both are done to every Believer in an inſtant, who are found alive at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming. <hi>Elijab's Tranſlation,</hi> 2 Kings 2. and <hi>Enoch</hi>'s, Heb. 11.5. were Emblems of the <hi>change</hi> on Believers at <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſecond appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; as the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others, both in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and <hi>New,</hi> were of the general Reſurrection: And in ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they ſpoke of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.52,53. <hi>And the graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:93776:163"/> which ſlept, aroſe, and came out of the graves after his Reſurrection, and went into the holy City, and appeared unto many.</hi> But whatever the change on Saints at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming be to them, and if it may be thought a more eaſie Tryal than natural death is: It is certain, that the <hi>change</hi> that ſhall then paſs on the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will be far more dreadful, than bare dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is now. This is then, the only Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the general Appointment on all <hi>Men once to die.</hi> How amazing then is the Stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Men, that ſo few ſeriouſly think on it, and prepare for it? That ſo many Men and Women, that are under the Sentence of Death, that have the Seeds of Death in them, that live in a World, wherein all things that have life are dying before their Eyes, that live on Creatures, that loſe their Lives to ſupport theirs, that have ſo many Warnings of Death's ſure and ſpeedy Approach, are yet, after all, ſurprized by it when it comes, as if they had never heard of it? This ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is a ſad, both <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Effect,</hi> of the Plague of Unbelief. <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> that follow at Death's Heels, are matters of pure Faith. But <hi>Death</hi> is obvious to Senſe, Reaſon, and Univerſal Experience: Yet Men only think they <hi>may die,</hi> and do not entertain the Perſwaſion with Aſſurance into their Hearts and ſerious daily Thoughts, that they <hi>muſt die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Dying is not only unavoidable, but it is a <hi>new Tryal:</hi> None can tell what dying is. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny know what is to be ſick, to be in great pain, to faint and fall into a ſwoun (which is
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:93776:164" rendition="simple:additions"/> a little Image of death, as alſo the Heathen Poet called Sleep, <hi>Death's elder Brother.</hi>) But none knows what dying is. It was a very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Word a dying Chriſtian in this City ſpoke to my ſelf, when viſiting him a few Hours before his Death: <hi>No Man can tell another what dying is; I feel I am dying, but I cannot tell you what it is.</hi> Death is a Path that you never trode before; you never walked in it hitherto; you may have thought your ſelves to have gone a good way in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, but you never walked through it. <hi>Paul</hi> died daily. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. <hi>he was in deaths often.</hi> 2 Cor. 11.23. Yet he was a living Man then, when he ſaid ſo; and he dyed but once. All new Tryals require new ſupplies of Grace: And the Tryal of Death is quite new. When we are tempted one day, we may know what Temptation is thereby, and be thereby fitted for the next; but no paſt Experience, can teach us fully what dying is.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Dying is not only a <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>new Tryal,</hi> but it is <hi>ſuch a Tryal, in which a Man's All is concerned for Eternity.</hi> Immediately, on Death, follows Judgment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. Death is the <hi>dark Trance betwixt Time and Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> While we live, we are in <hi>time;</hi> when we are a <hi>dying,</hi> we are leaving <hi>time,</hi> and paſſing into <hi>eternity.</hi> When we are dead, we are quite and for ever out of <hi>time,</hi> and are in <hi>eternity</hi> for ever. If a Man miſcarry in this Paſſage, if a Man ſtumble in the dark Valley of death, if he fall here, he falls for ever. I would not have people to imagine, that the ſtreſs of their Salvation depends on their Frame, when a
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:93776:164"/> dying: For ſome Chriſtians, when near to death, have neither the uſe and exerciſe of <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> much leſs of <hi>Grace.</hi> But ſurely when the caſe of Mens Bodies permits Acts of a Man, or of a Chriſtian, there is great need of grace to enable us to die well.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Dying is a great <hi>Tryal of Faith.</hi> Tho' we know not fully what dying is, yet we may know ſo much of it, as to be convinced, that it is much harder to <hi>die in Faith,</hi> than to <hi>live by Faith,</hi> and yet <hi>living by Faith</hi> is the hardeſt thing we have to do in this World. To truſt in an unſeen God; to believe his unchangeable Love when we feel his Anger; to truſt his bare Word, when we ſee no appearance of Performance, but many to the contrary, are no eaſie things to the heſt. Our frequent Experience of the difficulty, and of our many failings in this daily Exerciſe, of <hi>living by Faith,</hi> may juſtly make us ſenſible of our need of great help of Grace, when we ſhall be called to the new and more hard Work of <hi>dying by Faith.</hi> To enforce this a little, conſider, 1. Uſually when death draws near to Men, and they draw near to it, the <hi>Eye of the Mind is clearer, and the Conſcience more tender, and ſharp-ſighted, in the review of their Life and Actions.</hi> Many never ſaw their Lives well, till they are juſt at the end of them. And many Believers walk ſo, as a ſpiritual review of their ways, breeds no ſmall Storm in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and Tryal and ſhaking to their Faith. Though Death be a dark Valley, yet great light of Convictions and Challenges, ſprings up in it. Wo to them that never knew, till they are a dying, what an <hi>awakened Conſcience</hi> is.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:93776:165" rendition="simple:additions"/> Ways that are pleaſing to Men when the evil day is put far away, look frightfully on them, when that day approacheth, and is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nigh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A dying time is a time <hi>wherein the Devil is very buſie.</hi> He fetcheth then his laſt ſtroke on <hi>Saints,</hi> and on <hi>Sinners.</hi> He doth his utmoſt to ſecure the Damnation of <hi>Sinners,</hi> that he may not loſe them at laſt. The Devil's Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of a dying Sinner, is a ſtrong one. He alſo doth his utmoſt againſt <hi>Believers,</hi> if not to marr their Salvation, yet to hinder their Conſolation. The Devil's parting Blow hath been dreadful to many a Saint. It is a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Where he is ſaid to have <hi>the power of death.</hi> It is true, there it is ſaid alſo, that <hi>Christ overcame him, and through death.</hi> Death is properly and ſtrictly in the Devil's Dominions. <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Devil's, though the Lord hath the wiſe ordering of both; he <hi>permits</hi> Sin, and <hi>inflicts</hi> Death; and Death lyes near the Devil's great Priſon, <hi>Hell.</hi> Through the Valley of death, there are <hi>two</hi> Paſſages, one leading to <hi>Hell,</hi> and another to <hi>Heaven.</hi> Moſt fall into the Pit; others are brought through, ſafe and ſound, by the Skill and Mercy of their bleſſed Guide, <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It fares here with <hi>Believers</hi> as with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers</hi> as with the <hi>Egyptians, Heb.</hi> 11.29. <hi>By faith they paſſed through the Red Sea as by dry Land; which the Egyptians eſſaying to do, were drowned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Judgment and Eternity, when near, and ſeen at hand, are awful things:</hi> And a near view of them will try Faith greatly. This view
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:93776:165" rendition="simple:additions"/> blows away the Preſumption and Hope of the Hypocrite. <hi>Job</hi> 27.8. <hi>What is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul?</hi> Job 11.20. <hi>Their hope is as the giving up of the Ghoſt.</hi> His Hope lived as long as he lived; and when he dies, it dies alſo. Wo to them that have a dying hope, a hope that cannot out live Death. Chriſtians <hi>are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to a living or lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>He hath hope in his death,</hi> Prov. 14.32. The Man's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dies, but the Chriſtian's Hope and Faith lives. He <hi>lyes down in the Grave in hope,</hi> Pſal. 16.9. He <hi>dies in that Faith,</hi> he lived by. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is the <hi>helpfulneſs of Grace,</hi> in this time of great need, <hi>a time of dying.</hi> I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to living Men, but to ſuch as muſt die, and know not how ſoon. I ſhall only inſiſt on one thing at this time. The Grace of God helps Believers by <hi>ſtrengthening of their Faith.</hi> That is the help they mainly need in that hour. And this help ſtands in theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a dying Believer is helped by Grace to <hi>ſee death in Chriſt's hand.</hi> There is a vaſt difference betwixt <hi>Death in the Devil's hand</hi> who hath the power of it, and <hi>Death in Chriſt's hand,</hi> who is Maſter both of <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Devil:</hi> Betwixt a Man's ſeeing Death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Devil behind it, and with it, and a Man's ſeeing Death coming on him, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> with it. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Triumph roſe on this ground, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55,56,57. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave (or Hell) where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law, but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:93776:166"/> through our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> That, by which Death ſtings Men, is Sin unpardoned, and God's Holy Law binding Sin and Wrath on their Perſons. Victory over both Sin and the Law, comes by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> When this Victor, and Victory in <hi>Christ,</hi> is ſeen by a Believer, Death is defied and deſpiſed, as a ſting-leſs overcome thing. Much and ſtrong Faith is needful to enable a Man to <hi>play on the hole of this Aſp. Chriſt</hi> reveals himſelf to <hi>John,</hi> almoſt dead with fear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.17,18. <hi>Fear not, I have the keys of Hell, and of Death.</hi> Behold them in my Hand and behold me as the Lord of them. Should a Believer in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> fear any thing that <hi>Christ</hi> hath the power of? The <hi>bitterneſs of death is paſt to all Believers, by Chriſt's death and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over it.</hi> And if their Faith was ſtrong, their Fears would be ſmall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To have Faith <hi>enabled to look through death, and beyond death.</hi> If a Man's Eyes be fixed on Death only, and ſee no further, it is Death to look on Death: But when the Believers Eye of Faith is ſo quickened, that he can look through the Trance of Death, and ſee within the Vail where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, that is a bleſſed help fo Grace. Chriſtians Faith and <hi>Hope enters within the Vail,</hi> Heb. 6.19. And a view within the Vail, is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially deſirable and uſeful, when the Chriſtian is <hi>walking in the Valley of the ſhadow of death.</hi> Pſal. 23.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Faith is helped, <hi>when the dying Believer is enabled to caſt his Anchor on God in Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently in this laſt Storm.</hi> This laſt act of Faith is a great one. The more ſenſible a Man is, that he is on the point of eternal Ruin, the nearer he
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:93776:166" rendition="simple:additions"/> is to drop into Hell (without divine help) the more ſenſibly he acts Faith: Then the clingings and graſpings of Faith on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are ſenſible and ſtrong. When a Believer looks on himſelf, and on his way, and ſeeth nothing in them pleaſing or ſtaying to his Soul; he looks into the dark Paſſage before him, and its frightful to Heart and Fleſh; he looks on Judgment and Eternity as juſt at hand, and his Thoughts are ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up with their Greatneſs: In this caſe to ſtay his Soul, and ſay with dying <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God</hi> (tho' my Heart, my ways, be not ſo with God, as they ought to have been) <hi>yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure, and this all my ſalvation, and all my deſire;</hi> requires ſingular help of the Grace of God. To ſhut the Eyes, and give the hand to Chriſt, and to quiet the Mind, by truſting our Guide in this laſt Step, is a mighty Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>I would conclude this Diſcourſe with theſe four:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a great Myſtery of Faith, and a great Tryal of Faith, that the way to eternal Life, ſhould lye through the midſt of this dark Valley of Death.</hi> Our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> bought eternal Life for us, by the price of his Blood; he went through death to take poſſeſſion of his Kingdom and Glory; and yet his People muſt go through death to take Poſſeſſion of the Gift of eternal Life. If there were any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Room or Place for Prayer in this Affair, how many, and how earneſt Prayers would we make to be delivered from going in this way to Glory? But after a Life of Tryals, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:93776:167" rendition="simple:additions"/> and manifold Tribulations, this laſt is ſtill before us, and we muſt paſs through, and ſet our Feet in the cold Waters of this <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> ere we enter the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the lively hopes of Heaven, and ſweet fore-taſtes of it, we have had; after our Faith hath riſen to a full aſſurance: yet through death muſt all the Heirs of Glory paſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is no Wiſdom like that of preparing for this awful Hour.</hi> Job 14.14. <hi>If a man die, ſhall he live again? all the days of my appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time will I wait, till my change come.</hi> I will <hi>think</hi> on it, I will <hi>look</hi> for it, I will <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> for it. Men are wiſe or fooliſh, according to their faithful diligence, or unbelieving ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence in this preparing for death. Many have <hi>bewailed</hi> their <hi>neglect;</hi> never did any <hi>repent</hi> their <hi>diligence</hi> in this Work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There is no right and ſure way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Death, but by ſeeking ſaving acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Jeſus.</hi> If you ſet about the ſtudy of Holineſs, without <hi>Christ,</hi> you miſtake your way, and will never reach your end. But la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be intimately acquainted with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Communications of his Grace will make you holy. Death deals with Men, and billets them into their eternal Quarters, in Heaven or Hell, as Men are <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>out of Chriſt.</hi> Their Works, according to which they are judged, are but the Fruits and Effects of their different States. Theſe two different States of Men in this Life, <hi>in Christ,</hi> or <hi>not in Chriſt,</hi> are the Foundation of the two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent States in the next Life, <hi>in Heaven,</hi> or <hi>in Hell:</hi> Tho' all in <hi>Chriſt</hi> are holy, and all out of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are unholy.</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:93776:167"/>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>There is no Life truly comfortable, but that which hath a comfortable proſpect of Death and Judgment.</hi> Never envy the condition of them, who ſeem to be the only chearful Men in the World, whom one quarter of an hours ſerious thought of Death and Judgment, is enough to make them like <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> at his great Feaſt. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.6, <hi>Whoſe countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the joynts of his loins were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another.</hi> Amazement ſeized on Soul and Body. How can a Man be ſaid to live comfortably, that dare not think of Death, for fear of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his comfort? Miſerable is that Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that cannot bear a ſerious thought of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching unavoidable thing. This is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Mercy of the Lord to his People, that their true Conſolation doth not only ſtand and abide in the view of Death and Judgment, but it ariſeth from that view that is ſo terrible to all natural Men. This is the bleſſedneſs of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that his Grace allows them a right to, and can give them a poſſeſſion of. And therefore we ſhould come to the Throne of Grace for it. Then you are happy Chriſtians, when ſerious thoughts of Death, breed ſerious Joy.</p>

               <p>YOU have heard of the <hi>help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Grace of God in time of need;</hi> both in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and with particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſome ſpecial <hi>times of need.</hi> The laſt whereof, is the <hi>time of dying:</hi> This I left at laſt day; and would ſpeak a little more unto it, and then conclude all in a few Words.</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:93776:168"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Death</hi> is a Theme of great importance, and of very obvious Influence. If people would let it enter into their ſerious thoughts, and would take a ſerious and ſteddy view of it, they would quickly find more in it and about it, than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they did, or could hear, by all that is told them. Next to the ſaving Illumination of the Holy Ghoſt, with and by the Word, there is no better School for Men to learn, weigh, and duly to underſtand the things of God in, than a frequent and near view of death. What an edge would this put upon our Praying, Hearing, Worſhip, and Walking? Every thing that is done by Men as dying Perſons, is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well done. I ſhall only add this, that there are ſome ſorts of dying, that are very deſirable, in which the Grace of God is very <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>needful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Patient dying.</hi> Dying is not properly a Duty, but a Suffering. It is not our Act, but there is a manifold Exerciſe of Grace called for, in <hi>dying.</hi> Never did any Man act in dying, but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, he could lay down his life, and take it again, John</hi> 10.17,18. We cannot lay down our Lives, they are not our own. We are bid keep them as long as we lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can; and when the great Command comes, <hi>Return,</hi> we are to yield obedience to it. It is a great Bleſſing to have Patience for dying, and Patience in dying. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>You have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye may receave the Promiſe.</hi> And we often need Patience moſt, when juſt upon the receaving of the Promiſe. <hi>We ſhould run with patience the Race ſet before us.</hi> Heb. 12.1. And
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:93776:169" rendition="simple:additions"/> muſt of Patience is uſually moſt needful in the laſt, Stage of this Race. <hi>Patience ſhould have her, perfect work.</hi> Jam. 1.4. And the perfect and perfecting Work of Patience, is the laſt act of it. We all know that uſually death comes on by ſuch ſteps, as are grievous to the Fleſh: There are Pains, Sickneſs and Languiſhings, that are no ſmall Tryals of Patience; but theſe are in a manner but Tryals of the Patience of the Fleſh: There are other things about dying, that Patience is tryed by; as time and place, and many Circumſtances, that it is no ſmall or eaſie thing to be quietly ſubmitted to. <hi>Javob,</hi> the Heir of the Promiſe, goes down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Joſeph</hi> for Bread, after he is ſtarv'd our of the Land of Promiſe, and muſt die in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and leave his Family there, where they were to be long and heavily oppreſſed, as the Lord told his Grandfather <hi>Abraham. Gen.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt die on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan: David</hi> muſt not ſee a Stone laid in the Temple: <hi>Joſiah</hi> muſt die in Battel, and that, by <hi>not hearkening to the words of Necho from the mouth of God.</hi> 2 Chron. 35.22. But what of ſuch ſad Circumſtances of dying? did not <hi>our Lord himſelf,</hi> die under a dark Cloud on his dear Father's Face, and on his own bleſſed Soul? <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> were ſad Words from the ſad Soul of our dying bleſſed Lord. His Diſciples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him, the Sun forſook him, Earth and Hell bandyed againſt him; yet all was nothing to his Father's forſaking him. How bitter was this to our Lord? and yet how ſweet is it to the Faith of Believers? If you be called to die under a Cloud, remember, the Lord, the Heir, the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:93776:169"/> Purchaſer of Heaven, went to Heaven in the greateſt Storm, that ever blew from Earth, and Hell and Heaven, on any man's Face at death. Men are aſhamed to expreſs any quarrel againſt dying, but there are many things about it, that make us needy of much Grace to help to quiet ſubmitting unto it, both in ſubſtance, and all circumſtances attending it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Safe dying.</hi> This is very needful, and it is Grace's doing. Many die Patiently, as Men think, that die not ſafely. <hi>There are no bands in the death of the wicked</hi> ſometimes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.4. Some go out of this Life to Hell more calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than ſome of the Heirs of Glory paſs to their bleſſed home. Safe dying, is to die without any hurt to the Soul; that when the <hi>Cage</hi> of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is broken by death, the Soul, the <hi>Bird</hi> may take Wing, and fly ſtraight and ſafe to Heaven. <hi>Death is the Believers,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. as well as Life. But what have we to do with death, or death with us? It is a <hi>black Boat,</hi> that we muſt ſail out of time to Heaven in: And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſteers the Boat, and lands all Believers ſafely on Heaven's Shore. This is all we have to do with death. And when all the Paſſengers are brought over, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will burn this ugly Boat. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14,15. <hi>And death and hell</hi> (or the Grave) <hi>were caſt into the lake of fire; this is the ſecond death. And whoſoever was not found written in the book of Life, was caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> And then in the <hi>New Jeruſalem, there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow nor crying, neither ſhall there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more pain; for the former things are paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> Rev. 21.4. Who would not venture to paſs out of this bad World to that bleſſed Land, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:93776:170"/> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Conduct, though ſailing through the Gulf of death, be unpleaſant in it ſelf to us? Men for Gain will ſail from one end of the Earth to the other, through heat and cold, and ſtormy Seas and Winds, and manifold Perils, in the probable hope of advantage. But Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may be aſſured that they ſhall arrive at their Port. Never did a Believer in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> die or drown in his Voyage to Heaven. They will be all found ſafe and ſound with the Lamb on Mount Zion. <hi>Chriſt</hi> loſeth <hi>none</hi> of them; nay, <hi>nothing</hi> of them. <hi>John</hi> 6.39. Not a Bone of a Believer is to be ſeen in the Field of Battel. They are all <hi>more than conquerors, through him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them,</hi> Rom. 8.37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is very deſirable to have an <hi>honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable dying.</hi> It is a part of the Vanity of this World, that many dote upon, an <hi>honourable Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</hi> Some reſpect indeed ſhould be paid to the dead Bodies of Believers; but <hi>honourable dying</hi> is a great deal more conſiderable, than that Men call <hi>an honourable Burial.</hi> Our Lord told <hi>Peter</hi> of his dying, <hi>John</hi> 21.19. <hi>This ſpake Jeſus, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying by what death Peter ſhould glorifie God.</hi> That is honourable dying, that brings Glory to God. <hi>Paul</hi> is confident of this, as to himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20. <hi>According to my earneſt expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and my hope, that in nothing I ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but that with all boldneſs, as always, ſo now alſo, Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.</hi> The moſt honourable dying, is dying <hi>for the Lord,</hi> this Honour is not given to all his Saints. All Saints <hi>die in the Lord, and bleſſed are they,</hi> Rev. 14.13. Our deſire ſhould be, to be enabled by his
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:93776:170"/> Grace, to hear our dying Teſtimony to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Goſpel. There have been ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions given to the Conſciences of Sinners, wonderful Supports to the Hearts of ſurviving Saints, by the honourable dying of ſome Believers. Their example, their words, their very looks and Behaviour in the Shadow of death, have been of great uſe to them that have ſeen and heard them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is alſo deſirable, to have the Mercy of <hi>comfortable dying. To have an entrance mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to us abundantly into the everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.11. The Lord's dealings with his people in this matter, are a great depth. Some that have given moſt ſhining Evidences of the truth and ſtrength of the Grace of God in them, who have ſpent their days eminently to the Lords Praiſe, and to the edifying of his Body the Church, have gone to Heaven under a Cloud: Others, that were hardly known or regarded in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Flock, have gone off the Stage triumphantly. No Obſerver can eſcape the notice of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Therefore we muſt not ſay, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in dying is a certain ſign of eminency in Grace, or of tenderneſs in Walking. It is not very unuſual, to ſee the greateſt Storm overtake, even a ſtrong Believer, juſt as he is putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Harbour. However, this Diſpenſation of the Lord's Grace in granting a comfortable <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,</hi> is what we ſhould beg earneſtly, and pray for heartily. I believe that there are few Chriſtians ſo caſt down with Fears, and clouds, and darkneſs, but if they could be aſſured that all ſhall be diſpell'd at death (and it is ſometimes ſo) and that they ſhould have a clear Evening, and ſtrong Conſolation in their laſt hours, they
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:93776:171" rendition="simple:additions"/> would bear their preſent Sorrows better. Tho' comfortable dying be not ſimply neceſſary to the Salvation of a Believer; yet it is a Bleſſing more valuable, than many others that are more in our Prayers. Grace can help to it; and a precious help it is, and we ſhould mind it much in our Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace. So much of theſe <hi>times of need,</hi> and of the <hi>help of Grace</hi> in them.</p>
               <p>There are a few Exhortations from this whole Doctrine of the <hi>helpfulneſs of Grace in a time of need,</hi> that I would conclude this Text with.</p>
               <p>The general Exhortation is this, <hi>Learn not only to ſubmit, as to what is determined, and that you cannot alter, but to be heartily content with this wiſe diſpenſation of God about your Need and his Grace, as a Contrivance becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wiſdom, and levelled at your Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As,</hi> 1. <hi>That our Neceſſities are ſo many, ſo great, and ſo unavoidable; and yet there is a ſufficient ſupply provided for them.</hi> The new Creature is the moſt needy Creature of all God's Creation. The Lord hath framed the new Creature in a ſingular way, and for a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe and end. All other Creatures have their Being from God, and have that Being continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God in the common Courſe of his wiſe and powerful Providence. But the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not only of and from God, but it is wrought and hath its being in <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> and its Life is continued by a continual graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Efflux</hi> from him, <hi>for without him the new Creature can do nothing,</hi> John 15.5. Let not ſuch a Thought ariſe in your Heart (or if it
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:93776:171"/> ariſe, give it no entertainment) why hath God made this new Creature ſo needy a Creature as it is? Surely he might have done otherwiſe. He made the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> in another State: He was made perfect in Soul and Body immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: His State was perfect; he needed little, and all at hand: But the new Creature is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med weak and neceſſitous, the difference is as great betwixt the <hi>first Adam</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian at his Regeneration,</hi> as betwixt <hi>perfect Adam,</hi> and a <hi>young Babe</hi> newly born, or a Child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved in the Womb. Yet the Lord hath made proviſion of Grace ſufficient for all theſe Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. And he loves the glory of his Grace ſo, and takes ſo great delight in giving of his Grace, that he not only lets the Heirs of this Grace fall into the common Pit of Sin and Miſery with others, and ſometimes deeper than many of them that are left, that his Grace may be glorified, in <hi>loving them out of the pit of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raption,</hi> as <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Word is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. (for all that are converted, are plucked out of their natural damnable State, by a mighty Act of the Love of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.4.) But when he hath pulled them out, he ſets them down in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace, in ſo indigent and weak a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they may glorifie him by begging and believing, and he may glorifie himſelf in giving of his Grace to them. Who ſhould find fault with this wiſe way?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſatisfied that <hi>this Grace which is your Supply, is all in Chriſt Jeſus, and not in your own hand.</hi> Since <hi>Adam</hi> fell and ruined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all his Poſterity, by having his and their Stock in his own hand, and ſinning it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:93776:172"/> the Lord in Mercy hath reſolved never to intruſt a meer Man again with his own Stock; but hath lodged all the Grace his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſaved and ſupplyed by, in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s hand; and there it is ſafe. <hi>Adam</hi> was created perfect, and had a ſufficient Stock to have enriched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all his Off-ſpring; but he was left to his <hi>Free will,</hi> and ſo came on it. This is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſgrace to Man's <hi>Free will.</hi> What muſt the <hi>Free will of a Sinner</hi> be able to do, when the <hi>Free will of perfect ſinleſs Man,</hi> opened the Door to Sin, and Death, and Ruin upon the whole World of Mankind? It is therefore gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and wiſely provided, that <hi>Free will</hi> ſhall have no hand in the Salvation of Sinners (and indeed, <hi>Free will to good</hi> is but a vain Name, uſurped by willing and wilful Slaves of Sin) and that in its ſtead, the <hi>Free Grace</hi> of God in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhall be, and do all in all. But we are ſo proud, that we would fain have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in our own hand; and are ſo uſed to ſenſe, and unskilful in Believing, that we can hardly reckon that our own, that is not in our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and at our diſpoſing. But in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Lord conſults the Intereſt of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Security of our Salvation, and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supplies, by lodging our All in <hi>Chriſt's</hi> hand, who is able to keep it ſafely for us, and ready and willing to give forth of it to us, according to our real neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be ſatisfied with this, <hi>That the ſpecial times of our need are not uſually known to us before they come.</hi> There is none of the people of God, nor of the Children of Men, that uſually know twenty four hours before, what Temptations and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:93776:172"/> Tryals they may meet with. We know, we may be tempted, but we know not, when, nor how, and in what part the Adverſary may aſſault us, or with what Weapons. We know, we may be afflicted, but we know not with what Rod, nor when. We know we muſt die, but we know not how, nor when. There is a fooliſh and ſinful Curioſity in our Nature, that raiſeth deſires to know future things concerning our ſelves. It were well if Men were duly deſirous to know from the Word, what their eternal State ſhall be. But in other things that may befal us in time, it is dangerous Curioſity to be inquiſitive. People imagine that it would be of great advantage to them to fore-know future Evants as to themſelves. But I am ſure it would be a great diſadvantage, and what you would quickly repent of. If the Lord ſhould reveal to any of you, and ſet in a clear Light before the Eyes of your Mind, all the particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, Tryals, and Afflictions, and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you are to meet with in ſeven Years time to come; what a dread would it be to you? You would ſoon beg that it might be forgot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. It is a great deal better for us, that future things that belong to God, are ſecret and kept from us; and that we are led on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and come to the Waters in our way to Heaven, one after another, and get through them, by the gracious Conduct of our bleſſed Guide, <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He will give no Chriſtian a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and exact Map of all his Way, and Stages, and Entertainment in this Wilderneſs-Journey to Heaven, though our, Lord hath fixed them all in his Decree. Should it not be
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:93776:173"/> enough for us, that he will lead us well, and ſafely; that no Water ſhall drown us, that he will never leave us, but be with us wherever he leads us, and will bring us ſafe home at laſt to his Fathers Houſe?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be ſatisfied with this part of his wiſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>That this Supply of his Grace to help in time of need, muſt be come for.</hi> Not only that we <hi>may come</hi> for it, which is a great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge; but that we <hi>muſt come</hi> for it, if we would have it. Is there any ſo unreaſonable as to find fault with this Order? is it not fair and eaſie, <hi>ask and have?</hi> Would any have Grace to help them, unſought? If you would have it; you are asking it. Is it not fit then to come for it, and tell <hi>Chriſt</hi> you would have it? If you would not have it, you are praying againſt it: And wicked are thoſe Prayers, that are in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from the Grace of Chriſt? Every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever will find his Heart reconciled to this Order. They know that there is a Bleſſing in coming, as well as a Bleſſing to be got by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And moſt Chriſtians, I am apt to think, continue their Approaches to the Throne of Grace, as much, if not more, from the <hi>Delight</hi> they find in coming, as from the <hi>Profit</hi> they find by coming; though theſe two are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent. <hi>He that delights not himſelf in the Lord, will not always call upon God.</hi> Job 27.10. So much for this general Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Exhort.</hi> In the next place, I would ſpeak ſomewhat to them that are not acquainted with the Grace of God, nor with the Throne of Grace. <hi>Graceleſs people</hi> is ſo bad a name, that few will
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:93776:173" rendition="simple:additions"/> own it, tho' many deſerve it. Such fill up much room in moſt. Aſſemblies, and ſometimes may ſtep up into the <hi>Pulpit</hi> in the name of Miniſters of that Grace of God, they never knew but in a Book. But God calls all by their right names, and only can make Men anſwer to thoſe names. Let theſe four things enter into ſuch Folks Thoughts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>navoidably a time of need will come, that the Grace of God can only help in.</hi> None, but a great Atheiſt can, make any doubt of this. Doſt thou believe there is a God? that thou art a Mortal Man, whom a few more days will turn out of this World? Doſt thou believe that thou haſt an immortal Soul, that muſt be for ever? (and how much a Beaſt is that Man, and worſe than a Beaſt, that doubts of any of theſe?) If thou believe theſe plain Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, canſt thou doubt but a time of need will come, wherein nothing can ſtand thee in any ſtead, but only this God's Mercy, and Grace?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This preſent time you have, is the only time given you for preparing for the time of need that muſt come.</hi> How little is that precious golden Talent, <hi>Time,</hi> laid out for that the Lord gives it for? Can Men think that God gives them time, to ſpend it in the ways they ſpend it? That muſt be ill-ſpent time, that is ſpent ſo, as Men know they muſt either repent of, or periſh by. We are bid <hi>redeem the time,</hi> Eph. 5.16. But moſt Men throw it away, or fell it to Sin and Satan, as if they had no the for it. The beſt uſe of time, is to ſpend it in preparing for Eternity. <hi>All the days of my
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:93776:174" rendition="simple:additions"/> appointed time will I wait, till my change come,</hi> Job 14.14. Theſe are well-ſpent Days. But how few of the Hours of your Days are thus ſpent?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>There can be no greater folly, than to neglect this preſent only ſeaſon of preparing for an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable time of extremity.</hi> Our Lord in the Parable, calls the five negligent Virgins, <hi>fooliſh, Matth.</hi> 25.2. If a Man throw away his Eſtate, in Folly and Vanity, the World will brand him with the name of a Fool, and juſtly: If a Man throws away his Health and Life, there is Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that too. But for a Man to throw away his Soul, and all his hopes of well-being for Eternity, is the rankeſt of all Folly; yet is the World ſo full of ſuch Fools, that very few give it its true Name. He muſt be greatly plagued with blindneſs and ſtupidity, that is not convinced, that that is the greateſt Folly, that ſhuts a Man eternally out of Heaven, and locks him up in Hell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There can <hi>be no reflexion and remorſe more ſad and bitter, than that, that riſeth on the Review and Senſe of this Folly, when it is reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs.</hi> We read of <hi>the worm that dieth not, Mark</hi> 9.44,46,48. This is commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Conſcience ſtings <hi>two</hi> ways; and one way, more dreadfully than the other. Conſcience ſtings for Sin, as it is an offence againſt God, a breach of his Holy Law, and as it expoſeth the Sinner to God's dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Anger. But Conſcience ſtings more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for <hi>neglecting the Remedy for Sin;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and revealed to Men in the Goſpel. Therefore our Lord lays the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:93776:174" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the World that periſheth under the Goſpel, on this. <hi>John</hi> 3.19. It is not laid on <hi>the evil of their deeds,</hi> but on this, that their love to their deeds, made them hate the Light that diſcovered them, and the Grace that only can pardon and heal them. Men periſh not under the Goſpel, becauſe they are Sinners againſt God's Law (though the leaſt Sin deſerves Hell; and they that have not the Light of the Goſpel, are juſtly judged by the Law) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe not in <hi>Jeſus Christ, John</hi> 3.18. And Believers in <hi>Chriſt</hi> are not ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Holy (though all that believe, are Holy) but becauſe they are in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith: That the Glory of Salvation may be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s entirely, and the blame of Mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition under the Goſpel, may be their own intirely.</p>
               <p>Let Men therefore prevent this dreadful Ruin, by giving an ear to him that calleth them. <hi>Chriſt</hi> offers you Salvation from a Throne of Grace: Come and take it: Come and put forth your Hand, and take and eat of the Tree of Life, and live for ever. You muſt all ſhortly ſtand before <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Throne, when it will be no more a Throne of Grace. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> That will be a time of great need; and none can ſtand with Peace before that Throne, but they that have been acquainted with this Throne of Grace in my Text. <hi>Chriſt on the Throne of Grace,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt on the Judgment-ſeat,</hi> is the ſame <hi>Chriſt. Christ in the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt on the Clouds,</hi> is the ſame <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Yet we muſt diſtinguiſh: <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the Throne of Grace is
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:93776:175" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>no Judge;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the Judgment-Seat, hath <hi>no Grace to diſpenſe.</hi> Now is his time of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing Grace; then will be the day of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Deſpiſers of Grace, and of giving the Crown of Glory, to the Receavers of his Grace.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, I would give a few Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto real Chriſtians, in order to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of Grace to help in time of need.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Lay the Foundation ſure;</hi> a time of need will try it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Other Foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Father hath laid <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, behold I lay in Zion for a foundation, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious corner-ſtone, a ſure foundation: He that believeth ſhall not make haſte.</hi> Applyed to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.6. The faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, lay <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a Foundation. 1 Cor. 3.10. <hi>According to the grace of God, which is given unto me, as a wiſe Maſter-builder, I have laid the foundation.</hi> But how can a poor Sinner lay <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf? Turn but the Words, and the Queſtion is anſwered: <hi>Thy laying of Chriſt for a Foundation, is thy laying thy ſelf upon Chriſt as a Foundation;</hi> and it is neither more nor leſs, nor any thing elſe. Caſt your ſelves, and all your Concerns about Salvation on <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone. Let him bear all: He only can, and calls for this from you. One of the firſt Queſtions that riſeth in the mind of a Chriſtian in a time of need, is this: Is the Foundation right laid? Am I founded on <hi>Chriſt?</hi> The Storm will try the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:93776:175" rendition="simple:additions"/> Foundation: It were great wiſdom to ſecure that before the Storm come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Clear up your Evidences against a time of need.</hi> The <hi>Evidences</hi> of a Chriſtian are not his Charters for Heaven (the Covenant of Grace contains them) but they are as Light, by which a Chriſtian reads his Charters. Evidences are of great uſe in a time of need. They ſtand in Gods Work in us. Our Faith ſtands on <hi>God's word of Promiſe to us,</hi> and on <hi>Chriſt's Work for us;</hi> the Evidences of Believers, ſtand in <hi>God's gracious working in,</hi> and <hi>on,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> them. Theſe <hi>four</hi> Words I would give about your <hi>Evidence.</hi> 1. <hi>When you cannot perceave them, ſearch for them,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the Faith: prove your own ſelves: know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except you be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?</hi> or diſapproved. The Exhortation is ſo delivered, as to perſwade us, that very narrow and exact ſearching is called for in this Work. May not that Chriſtian's Heart condemn him, who is daily complaining of his Ignorance of his State, when he knows that ſerious ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination is neglected by him? 2. <hi>If upon ſearching you cannot yet find, beg the help of the Spirit of God to diſcover his own work in you.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Now we have receaved, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God.</hi> The Illumination of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is not only ſimply needful, to give us a ſaving knowledge of the Myſtery of the Goſpel, but is ſo alſo to give us a right knowledge of the my ſtory of his Grace in us. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17,18,19. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle prays for the Spirit, for both theſe ends.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:93776:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>David</hi> prays for the Lord's help in his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of himſelf. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139,23,24. A Heart laid open to God's ſearch, a Heart willing to have all in it viewed and diſcovered by the Lord, is an upright ſincere Heart. <hi>Whoever is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to know his worſt, is not ſtark naught:</hi> Yet he that ſeeth but the leaſt half of his badneſs, will judge himſelf to be very bad. 3. If you cannot yet find your Evidences, <hi>make them preſently.</hi> Many Chriſtians need this advice. They formerly had Evidences of their Intereſt in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they had a clear fight of the Truth and Fruits of their Faith, and Love, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: this refreſhing Sight is gone, and they <hi>mourn as without the Sun,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>chap</hi> 30.28. Let ſuch take this courſe: Act afreſh that Grace, when you are doubtful whether you ever acted it before. See you at preſent no clear Evidences of your former believing? Act Faith preſently. There are few things more evident, than ſtrong believing is, in the very acting of it. And if the acting of Faith on <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>ſpeaking in righteouſneſs, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſaue,</hi> Iſa. 63.1. be evident to thee, thou haſt the beſt Evidence for eternal Life, that is in all the Bible: Moſt of the Promiſes run this way. <hi>Whoever believeth on the Son of God, hath everlaſting life.</hi> John 3.15,16,17. It is the gracious and wiſe Conſtitution of the Lord; that no Grace can be ordinarily evident to a Man in whom it is, ſo, as in, and by, the exerciſe and acting of it. 4. When you find Evidences of God's Work in you, <hi>Bleſs the Worker and Diſcoverer of them, and believe more and more.</hi> Say with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 71.14.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:93776:176" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
                  <hi>I will hope continually, and will yet praiſe thee more and more.</hi> It is juſt with God, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful too, that darkneſs ſhould come upon that Man's Evidences, who ſits down upon them, and bleſſeth himſelf in them, more than he doth God for them; and pleaſeth himſelf in a life of Senſe, with neglecting the life of Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Make good uſe of your former Experiences of the Mercy and Grace of God, helping you in former times of need.</hi> The Lord's kindneſs is not ſhown to us for the preſent time only, but for the time to come. It is not given to us, to play or pleaſe our ſelves with at preſent, but for good and needful uſes, for ſtrengthening of our Faith, exciting of Praiſe, and directing and encouraging us to come to the ſame Door, we were formerly relieved at. It is a part of the work of Faith, to look back on formerly-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed Mercy and Grace, as well as to look forward to the greater and better things to come. It is a great Sin, but very common, that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, who hath many Years Experience of the Mercy of God, if there be a ſtop put to the Stream of Mercy, he is often as much ſhaken in his Faith, as if he had never taſted that the Lord is gracious.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In preparing for a time of need, <hi>be careful to keep your Conſcience's clean.</hi> There is no worſe Company in an evil day, than an evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is worſe Company than the Devil's. His Company is that of a <hi>Tempter</hi> and <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> but an evil Conſcience is a <hi>Judge condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> and an <hi>Executioner</hi> tormenting a Man. Therefore <hi>herein exerciſe your ſelves to have a Conſcience void of offence toward God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:93776:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> Men.</hi> Acts 24.16. It is uſually ſeen, that times of great Tryals, do dart in ſome Light into Mens Conſciences, and do make Men look into their Hearts and Ways more narrowly, and ſpy ſmall Faults that they could not ſee at other times: For they are <hi>days of darkneſs</hi> in one ſenſe, and <hi>days of light</hi> in another. Study therefore to keep thy Conſcience clean and pure, by holy and tender walking, and by daily believing: For <hi>it is the Blood of Chriſt that only can purge the Conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.14. And let me aſſure you of this (and if you will not believe it, I dare ſay you will feel it, and feel it the more <hi>then,</hi> if you believe it not <hi>now</hi>) that ſuch as make all their care about their Conſciences, to ſtand in watchfulneſs about their Hearts and Ways, and are utterly eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from believing Applications to the <hi>Blood of Jeſus,</hi> when an <hi>evil Day</hi> and an <hi>evil Conſcience</hi> meet together (and meet they will) that they will be in a ſad and dreadful Confuſion. And no better will their Condition be, who upon a falſe Pretence (and in this caſe it is always falſe) of <hi>truſting in Chriſt,</hi> have no care either of their Conſcience or Converſation. <hi>The My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Faith is to be held</hi> (and kept) <hi>in a pure Conſcience,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.9. <hi>We ſhould hold Faith and a good Conſcience,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.19. they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be got, nor kept, but together: Whoever ſuffers Shipwrack of the one, loſeth the other. Chriſt is the <hi>Saviour of Sinners,</hi> but he is no <hi>Miniſter of Sin. Gal.</hi> 2.17. <hi>He came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>Not to ſave Saints,</hi> for there are none in it but of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:93776:177"/> and his making <hi>Sinners</hi> to be <hi>Saints,</hi> is a notable part of his <hi>ſaving,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. The Inheritance is for them <hi>that obtain forgiveneſs of Sins, and who are ſanctified by Faith in him.</hi> Acts 26.28. None are ſaved but the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; and none are ſanctified but by Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> There may be in an Unbeliever, a Picture and ſhadow of Holineſs; but it is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination in the ſight of God; whatever the Man that hath it, or they that ſee it, may think of it. A <hi>holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever,</hi> or an <hi>unholy Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> never was ſince the World began, nor will be, while it laſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Multiply your Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace before the time of need come.</hi> Happy were that Chriſtian, that could cry as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for that Grace (that can help him) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time of need come, as he will ſee it needful to have it, when that time doth come. But it is the weakneſs of <hi>our Minds as Men,</hi> and of <hi>our Grace as Chriſtians,</hi> that we cannot take up ſo clear a Proſpect of things to come, and that they are not ſo big in our Eyes at a diſtance, as when preſent. Yet by Faith we may foreſee times of need, and ſhould pray much for Grace to help us, when that time comes. Suppoſe you ſhould for twenty years together, beg that Grace and Mercy, that you ſhould not have occaſion for, till thoſe years were expired; would there be any hurt in it?</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>In any ſpecial Proſpect of an approaching time of need, make ſpecial Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace for Grace, to help in that time.</hi> There are two things in theſe Addreſſes I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to you. 1. Let them be <hi>Perſonal,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:93776:178"/> Partticular</hi> and <hi>Secret.</hi> Our Lord's Direction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.6. Many Chriſtians find it an eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thing to keep a <hi>day of Prayer</hi> with others, than to ſpend <hi>an hour in Prayer</hi> in ſecret by themſelves. It were far eaſier to know a Man's Frame and State by his ſecret dealings with God, (if we were acquainted with them) than by all his Profeſſions and Duties beſides. 2. Let theſe Addreſſes be ſometimes <hi>ſolemn and long.</hi> There are ſome Mercies not to be got (as <hi>ſome ſort of Devils not to be cast out</hi>) <hi>but by faſting and prayer,</hi> Matth. 17.21. <hi>Secret, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Faſts,</hi> I am afraid, are very rare amongſt Chriſtians in our Days. <hi>Chriſt</hi> commands and directs us about them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.16.17,18. as well as about <hi>ſecret Prayer,</hi> Matth. 6.6,7. <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould not load <hi>Christians,</hi> with work above the Strength of their Bodies, or Minds, or Grace. But ſurely, it is but reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice required of you, that you ſhould make Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace, in ſome ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to your need of that Grace, that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed from it.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>four</hi> things, which, if they were the Fruit of my ſpeaking, and of your hearing ſo often from this Text, we ſhould both have cauſe to bleſs the Lord, <hi>who teacheth his people to profit,</hi> Iſa. 48.17.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If you learn to pray better, and to ply Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er more. David gave himſelf to Prayer,</hi> Pſal. 109.4. The Apoſtles, thoſe extraordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Primitive Church, <hi>gave themſelves continually to Prayer, and to the Miniſtery of the Word.</hi> Acts 6.4. There are times in which private Chriſtians, <hi>ſhould give themſelves
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:93776:178"/> to faſting and prayer,</hi> 1. Cor. 7.5. If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, he will make you pray, and reach you with Briars and Thorns, if you will not yield to more gentle Methods. How ſad is the Reflection that riſeth in the Heart, under ſome heavy Tryal, <hi>This is brought on me for my indulged diſtance, and eſtrangement from God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If you learn <hi>to mind Chriſt more, and make more uſe of him in your Praying.</hi> He is the King on this Throne of Grace. As much as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is out of your Minds in Praying, ſo much are you out in Praying, and your Praying out of that it ought to be. That which we beg, is out of <hi>Chriſt's Store:</hi> In <hi>whoſe Name</hi> do we beg it, but in his? for <hi>whoſe ſake,</hi> but for his? Out of <hi>whoſe hand</hi> do we receave what we ask and get, but out of his? It is marvellous that People ſhould pretend to Prayer, and think they pray, who yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>all in all,</hi> in all right Prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you learn to <hi>mind and plead more God's Free-Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, in your praying. Free-Grace</hi> is the ſenſible humble Min's Plea: he is a proud ignorant Perſon, that ſeeks or uſeth any other Plea at God's Throne of Grace. <hi>Free-Grace</hi> is the only thing that Faith can firſt lay hold on; it's a Plea that any Man may uſe: it is the conſtant and powerful Plea of a wiſe Beſiever. It anſwers every caſe, and ſuits eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prayer; and the <hi>loweſt Caſe,</hi> and the <hi>higheſt Prayer,</hi> beſt.</p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:93776:179"/>
               <p n="4">4. If you learn, <hi>never to leave off improving of chriſt, and pleading for Grace at this Throne of Grace, till ye have no more need of Grace:</hi> And that will never be as long as you live. If any Man fall into ſuch a Dream, that he is got beyond the need of Grace, and ſo of Praying, he is one that never rightly knew <hi>himſelf,</hi> nor <hi>Grace, nor Chriſt,</hi> nor <hi>Praying.</hi> The Believer knows he ſtands in need of Chriſt and Grace, and therefore prays, <hi>as long as he liveth,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> reſolved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.2. And when he comes to die, and hath prayed his laſt Prayer, with <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7.59. <hi>Lord Jeſus, receave my Spirit,</hi> and gets it anſwered, Praying, Believing, and the <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> it ſelf, as to him, is at an end; and everlaſting Praiſes before the <hi>Throne of Glory, of God, and of the Lamb,</hi> begin, never to have an end.</p>

                  <hi>Even ſo, come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly,</hi> Finiſh thy Work; fulfil all thy Promiſes; anſwer fully all the Prayers of all thy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:93776:179"/> Bride, and for her Salvation; and therefore he is amiable to her in that Dreſs. Believers in <hi>Chriſt</hi> are contracted to <hi>a ſlain Husband,</hi> but ſhall be married to him in a far other Manifeſtation of himſelf. How great is the difference betwixt our <hi>deareſt Lord Jeſus,</hi> under his <hi>Croſs,</hi> and under his <hi>Crown?</hi> And yet under his <hi>Croſs</hi> he is infinitely amiable to a Believer's Heart and Eye? If it were not that the Light of that glorious day of his Appearance, will prevent all Miſtakes, <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them which are ſaved</hi> (as they are called, for their Multitude out of all Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.24.) might doubt (but doubt they cannot, but wonder they will, both at him, and at themſelves, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10.) and ſay, Is this that bleſſed Saviour, I believed on ſo feebly? whom I truſted with my Soul and its Salvation, with ſo much fainting, and with ſo many Fears? is this he whom I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo little, and ſo coldly? Is this he, whom (all the time I liv'd on Earth, after he had revealed himſelf to me) I depended and lived on by Faith, and that with ſo many Stagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings through Unbelief, becauſe I knew not ſo well, as now I do, whom I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved</p>
               <p>And until this bleſſed Day come (and come it will, for it is promiſed, and ſworn by him, who cannot lie; it is not far off, for it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 1600 years ſince he teſtified, <hi>Surely I come quickly,</hi> Rev. 22.20.

Let his <hi>juſtifying Righteouſneſs</hi> be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned before God, <hi>on Earth by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners,</hi> as it will be only mentioned by <hi>glorified praiſing Saints in Heaven.</hi> Let the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> reared up by the Father in his Son, and conſecrated by the Blood of this Son, <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> be revealed to the darkened World, and ſet up amongſt the blinded Nations: And let Grace from thence be diſpenſed to many thouſands of periſhing Sinners.
